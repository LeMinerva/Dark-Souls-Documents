<text id="21630100">Crown of the Old Iron King
who once ruled this land.

The King sunk below the scorching iron,
met the one whose name must never
be repeated, and became Ichorous Earth.

But these were events of long ago,

the King's name.</text>
<text id="21640100">Crown of the Ivory King
who once ruled this land.

Far to the north, a King built a
great cathedral to appease the raging flame.
But when he sensed the degradation of
his soul, he left without a word, leaving
everything to Alsanna, who had,
unbeknownst, found a place at his side.

But these were events of long ago,
and today, no one even remembers
the King's name.</text>

The stunning arrangement of layered flowers
on this skirt is designed to capture the
attention of a candidate for the position.</text>
<text id="21700100">An ornamental helm commissioned by the
