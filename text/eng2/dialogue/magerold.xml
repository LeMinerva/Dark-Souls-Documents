<text id="77200000">What? Who're you?</text>
<text id="77200010">Who, me? I'm Magerold, who else?</text>
<text id="77200020">What? Have a look at my wares.</text>
<text id="77200030">##Fine, but they're not for everyone.</text>
<text id="77200040">##Well, I have rather peculiar taste,
so no complaints, all right?</text>
<text id="77200200">What? You again?</text>
<text id="77200300">You've quite unusual taste, don't you?</text>
<text id="77200400">Well? Where've you been?</text>
<text id="77200500">Finally decided to come and visit?</text>
<text id="77200600">Cheers!</text>
<text id="77200700">Very well, no pressure.</text>
<text id="77200900">Hey? Where you off to?</text>
<text id="77201000">I'm mainly a treasure hunter, you see.
I'm only a merchant on the side.</text>
<text id="77201100">I roam about, looking for a find,
following my instincts.</text>
<text id="77201200">I don't care what a thing is worth.
What matters is whether it grabs me.</text>
<text id="77201300">Do I enjoy what I do? Well...that's a good question.</text>
<text id="77201400">But I suppose I must, I...
I've been doing it for ages.</text>
<text id="77201600">There's good iron in these parts.
An old king even used it to build a castle.</text>
<text id="77201610">But the thing was too heavy, and it slowly sank into the ground.</text>
<text id="77201620">Fires spouted from the earth,
and...and the place turned into this.</text>
<text id="77201630">At least, that's what I'm told.
Not a bad story, eh?</text>
<text id="77201640">So, what'll it be? Anything for you today?</text>
<text id="77201800">Hey, You know that odd fellow? With the hulking blue sword.</text>
<text id="77201810">He talks really highly of it,
but I got a feeling it's a fake.</text>
<text id="77201820">I didn't want to disappoint him,
so I just sort of talked around it.</text>
<text id="77201830">Let me just say,
there are lots of "legendary swords" out there.</text>
<text id="77205000">But...what's the meaning of this!</text>
<text id="77205010">Ohh, just...just stay away, will you?</text>
<text id="77205020">You're a rotten bugger.</text>
<text id="77205030">Ow!</text>
<text id="77205040">Hey..hey, hey now, easy, easy with that!</text>
<text id="77205050">Eeg!</text>
<text id="77205060">What...what...what the devil!</text>
<text id="77206000">##So...guess I'll be moving along.</text>
<text id="77207000">I think we have similar taste.
Really I do.</text>
<text id="77207010">Here, you should like these.</text>
<text id="77208000">Have you heard of the shrine on the eastern edge of Drangleic?</text>
<text id="77208010">Built to honour the dragons, they say.</text>
<text id="77208020">If only I knew how to get there,
I'd go and I'd comb it for goodies.</text>
<text id="77208100">What is that? A petrified egg?</text>
<text id="77208110">From the shrine? Fantastic...</text>
<text id="77208120">Might...might you give it to me?</text>
<text id="77208130">I'm fascinated by it...
I'm begging you.</text>
<text id="77208200">How very kind of you.</text>
<text id="77208210">This thing is amazing...
Could it be a dragon egg?</text>
<text id="77208220">I feel invigorated... Just by holding it.</text>
<text id="77208300">Oh no, no, no, no, no, don't say that.
Give a bloke a chance.</text>
<text id="77208310">I'm begging you.
I really should have that!</text>
<text id="77208400">Oh, change your mind?</text>
<text id="77208410">Donating your stone egg after all?</text>
