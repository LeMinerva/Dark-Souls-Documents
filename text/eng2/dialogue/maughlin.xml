<text id="76100000">Err, oh, hello there!</text>
<text id="76100010">W-welcome, to my shop. I-I'm Maughlin, and I sell armour.</text>
<text id="76100020">Oh, sorry, I... Please, do have a look at my wares.</text>
<text id="76100030">I could really use the business...
If you'd be so kind...</text>
<text id="76100100">Well, thank you, for coming back! Do take a look at my wares.</text>
<text id="76100200">Oh, hello again.
I-I hope you find something of use.</text>
<text id="76100400">Thanks very much.
And, do please come again.</text>
<text id="76100500">Well, I, I do hope I see you again.</text>
<text id="76100600">Oh, is something wrong?</text>
<text id="76100900">I came from the west, from Volgen.</text>
<text id="76100910">Have you been there? It's a lively place, vibrant with trade.</text>
<text id="76100920">Very competitive, of course.
And y-you have to grease the wheels to get anywhere.</text>
<text id="76100930">But I didn't have the funding for that,
so I left home in hopes
of striking gold.</text>
<text id="76100940">It's been years since then, and I've...
well I've made very little headway...hah hah</text>
<text id="76100950">I don't even know why I'm still here...</text>
<text id="76100960">Everything's all run-down and dying...
It's t-terrible for business, really...</text>
<text id="76101000">A group calling themselves the Blue Sentinels
have gained much power in Volgen.</text>
<text id="76101010">You can't even run a shop without their blessing.</text>
<text id="76101020">They claim to be working for the greater good,
oh...but it's absolute hogwash.</text>
<text id="76101100">Hmm...</text>
<text id="76101110">Oh, by the gods...Why the hell am I here? </text>
<text id="76101500">Oh, there you are!
I-I now offer buybacks.</text>
<text id="76101510">I-I'll purchase almost anything,
for the appropriate price.</text>
<text id="76101520">I've managed to save a good deal,
so I-I can afford to risk of a new venture.</text>
<text id="76101530">At the very worst, I'll just suffer a wee loss. Hmph.</text>
<text id="76101600">Oh, I was hoping that you would come.</text>
<text id="76101610">I've stocked some new things,
and I thought you might be interested.</text>
<text id="76101620">They've been selling rather well,
and I may step up operations soon.</text>
<text id="76101630">I'm...well I'm surprising even myself, to be honest.</text>
<text id="76101700">Forget to buy something? Go ahead, take your time.</text>
<text id="76101800">I'm glad to see you safe.
Take...take a look at my wares.</text>
<text id="76102000">Thanks very much.
Do come again!</text>
<text id="76102100">Always open for business.</text>
<text id="76102200">Finished already?</text>
<text id="76102400">Did I mention before that I'm not from these parts?</text>
<text id="76102410">I was on a journey...
And somehow ended up here...</text>
<text id="76102420">The desolation here was disenchanting at first.
But over time, things started to turn my way.</text>
<text id="76102430">Yeah, I-I've got a good few regulars now.</text>
<text id="76102440">They're all strangely desperate,
and quite willing to pay a premium.</text>
<text id="76102450">Sadly, some of them never come back.
But I try not to think about it.</text>
<text id="76102500">Have you seen that warrior
lugging that giant blue sword about?</text>
<text id="76102510">I'm no expert, but that appears to be a fine specimen.</text>
<text id="76102520">The monstrous thing has a peculiar design,
quite unlike anything found in Volgen.</text>
<text id="76102530">If you should speak to him,
would you ask him if he won't sell it?</text>
<text id="76102540">I'd have to take another look,
but I'm confident I could offer quite a price.</text>
<text id="76102600">That sword that you've got...
May I, um, have a look at it?</text>
<text id="76102610">Hmm, it's...yeah...it's interesting, it's...</text>
<text id="76102620">Oh, no, I'm afrai...sorry, I'm afraid this is a fake.
It's not worth much at all.</text>
<text id="76102630">The original must be somewhere,
I would imagine.</text>
<text id="76102700">I considered returning to my homeland,
but I've decided to stay a while longer.</text>
<text id="76102710">I've started to turn a handsome profit now,
and I can't bear to give it up.
Heh.</text>
<text id="76103000">Do I know you? Sorry...apologies,
I've been quite busy these days...</text>
<text id="76103010">Yeah...well...I'm now offering buybacks.
This service is available at anytime.</text>
<text id="76103020">I offer fair prices
for quality items.</text>
<text id="76103100">Um, sorry, have we met?
Oh sorry, it's just I've been awfully busy lately.</text>
<text id="76103110">Care to look over my wares? Please, be my guest.</text>
<text id="76103120">I upgraded my stock recently.
Although it may be a bit out of your reach...</text>
<text id="76103200">Looking for armour? Everything I offer is quite dependable.</text>
<text id="76103300">You need armour? Go ahead, see what I'm offering.</text>
<text id="76103500">Thanks for the purchase. Do come again.</text>
<text id="76103600">Are you sure? Well...I may sell out while you're away.</text>
<text id="76103700">Now, have some patience!</text>
<text id="76103800">I'm rich, I'm rich... Mwa hah hah!</text>
<text id="76103810"> I don't need to go home anymore! </text>
<text id="76103820">Home...home...? Where...where is home...?</text>
<text id="76105000">C-curses upon you! Enough of this!</text>
<text id="76105010">Oh it's y-you again?</text>
<text id="76105020">I-I did it...</text>
<text id="76105030">Eek!</text>
<text id="76105040">Who...what the?!</text>
<text id="76105050">Y-you won't get me!</text>
<text id="76106000">Did I mention I was...rich?</text>
<text id="76107000">In a spot of bother are we?</text>
<text id="76107010">Here, take this.
My compliments.</text>
