<text id="76900000">Are you from these parts?</text>
<text id="76900010">My name is Licia.</text>
<text id="76900020">I have come to spread the art of miracles,
a practice of which I am a disciple.</text>
<text id="76900030">I can see that you are well suited
to comprehend their wondrous power.</text>
<text id="76900040">But the cost of it? That's for your heart to decide.</text>
<text id="76900100">I'd heard awful rumours about this place,
and I'm afraid they were all true.</text>
<text id="76900110">The king, gone. The earth, ravaged.
The burden on the people weighs heavy.</text>
<text id="76900120">I fear that by now,
they may have scarce room in their hearts for miracles...</text>
<text id="76900200">Why did I come here? Well...</text>
<text id="76900210">Do I need any other reason,
than to spread the gospel of miracles?</text>
<text id="76900220">My preceptor always said this art
should be shared with the world.</text>
<text id="76900230">And such is my only wish.</text>
<text id="76900300">Sometimes I fight the urge
to pack up and go back home.</text>
<text id="76900310">It is, well...I must do this.</text>
<text id="76900320">And being out here all alone only
makes this a more fitting test of my fortitude.</text>
<text id="76900400">I expected this cathedral to be bustling,
but there's hardly a soul to be found here.</text>
<text id="76900410">Without any goings-on,
I'll have to move soon.</text>
<text id="76900420">To a place I could gull the...</text>
<text id="76900430">Sorry, help the gullible by teaching the good word... Hah hah...</text>
<text id="76901000">Oh, hello there... An honour to see you again.</text>
<text id="76901010">This room is not as it seems.
There are two, not one, pathways leading out.</text>
<text id="76901020">And only this lovely thing reveals the other path.</text>
<text id="76901030">And this, you lovely thing... Only runs on miracles!</text>
<text id="76901040">Shall I provide you with one?</text>
<text id="76901100">Just speak up if you're in need of miracles.</text>
<text id="76901110">That's why I'm here, after all.</text>
<text id="76901200">Go ahead, then.</text>
<text id="76901300">May the power of miracles be with you.</text>
<text id="76901310">Offer your souls to the gods.</text>
<text id="76901400">No need for miracles?</text>
<text id="76901410">The gods frown upon
such soul scrimpers!</text>
<text id="76901500">Oh? Done so soon?</text>
<text id="76901600">To cast miracles, you must have strong faith in the gods.</text>
<text id="76901610">Miracles began as tales told by gods.</text>
<text id="76901620">We preserve their will with lore, pray to their greatness,
and are blessed in return.</text>
<text id="76901630">You must nourish your faith.</text>
<text id="76901700">Miracles have been passed down through us
since the First Flame.</text>
<text id="76901710">Isn't it extraordinary to think they've existed
since the very origins of the world?</text>
<text id="76901720">And now, you can have this power for yourself.
Don't miss out on the road to enlightenment!</text>
<text id="76901800">What is the First Flame?</text>
<text id="76901810">Well, it's...</text>
<text id="76901820">Hmm, you're not ready to comprehend it,
I'm afraid!</text>
<text id="76901830">You require more faith! And more miracles. Many more miracles!</text>
<text id="76903000">You've had quite a journey, I can see...</text>
<text id="76903010">You must have a glorious number of souls by now...</text>
<text id="76903020">What a wonderful feeling that must be...
Heh heh...</text>
<text id="76903100">Curses... Puzzled me out, have you?</text>
<text id="76903110">At least now I can finish you off, guilt-free!
Hah hah!</text>
<text id="76905000">Hyahh! I've no choice, now!</text>
<text id="76905010">Back again, are you?</text>
<text id="76905030">Argh... Aargh!</text>
<text id="76905040">What are you doing!</text>
<text id="76905050">Please, stop this!</text>
<text id="76905070">Have faith...</text>
<text id="76906000">##Seek...miracles...</text>
<text id="76907000">You deserve to have these.
For your faith has truly deepened.</text>
<text id="76907010">Go on, and seek greater miracles.
With your faith,
you deserve no less!</text>
