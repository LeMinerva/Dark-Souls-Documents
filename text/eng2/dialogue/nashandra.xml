<text id="70200000">You have fought admirably on your journey,
cursed Undead.</text>
<text id="70200010">I am Nashandra,
Queen of Drangleic.</text>
<text id="70200110">A true monarch carries the weight of their souls.</text>
<text id="70200120">The last king of this land, King Vendrick, as he was called...</text>
<text id="70200140">He found the strength to rule his people,
and when the Undead were born, cursed...</text>
<text id="70200150">He found more strength, to face them.</text>
<text id="70200160">But in the end,
he never took the true throne.</text>
<text>#0Talk-2nd time</text>
<text id="70200210">Visit Vendrick.</text>

<text>#0Talk-2nd time after acquiring the King's Ring</text>
<text id="70200500">Brave Undead,
seek the throne.</text>
<text id="70200510">Follow the symbol of the monarch, and do what must be done.</text>
<text>#0Talk-1st time after acquiring the Ashen Mist Heart</text>
<text id="70200600">Brave Undead,
what did that dragon tell you?</text>
<text id="70200610">That thing is a prop,
a false deity.
Don't be fooled, my Undead.</text>
<text>#0Talk-2nd time after acquiring the Ashen Mist Heart</text>
<text id="70200720">Seek the forest, you,
where those wretched Giants slumber.</text>
<text>#0After defeating the Throne Defender &amp; Throne Watcher</text>
<text id="62700800">Brave Undead,</text>
<text id="62700805">you have proven yourself to me.</text>
<text id="62700810">Now, be one, with the Dark...</text>
<text id="70200020">##Brave Undead,
your arrival here
foreshadows your fate.</text>
<text id="70200100">##A true monarch is much more than a ruler of men.</text>
<text id="70200130">##He was less of a king than you might imagine.</text>
<text id="70200170">##And now he lies in the Undead Crypt, wasting away.</text>
<text id="70200200">##Brave Undead,
perhaps you are the true monarch.</text>
<text id="70200230">##I will wait here.
For you to settle things.</text>
<text id="70200300">##Brave Undead,
seek a fiercer curse.</text>
<text id="70200310">##Only one may rule.
And that one may well be you...</text>
<text id="70200400">##Brave Undead,
vanquisher of King Vendrick,
and bearer of the symbol of the monarch.</text>
<text id="70200420">##But to know if you are the true king...</text>
<text id="70200430">##...we will require the throne.</text>
<text id="70200440">##Brave Undead, follow the symbol of the monarch.
Surely you have it in you.</text>
<text id="70200450">##For this is your true purpose...</text>
<text id="70200700">##Brave Undead,
you've met that dragon?
That living, breathing sham.</text>
<text id="70200710">##A false deity,
offering nothing.</text>
<text id="70200730">##Use the symbol of the dragon to delve into their thoughts.</text>
<text id="70200740">##Brave Undead,
to the forest.
The Forest of Giants.</text>
<text id="70200750">##Before it's too late...</text>
<text id="70200900">##Ohh...The flame...the flame...</text>
<text id="70200910">##Souls...more souls...</text>
<text id="70205030">##How very dare you...</text>
<text id="70205040">##Tee hee...</text>
