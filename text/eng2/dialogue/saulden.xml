<text>#0Talk-1st time</text>
<text id="74100000">You're Undead...aren't you.</text>
<text id="74100010">You have that distinct scent.
The smell of irreversible fate.</text>
<text id="74100020">This is Majula.</text>
<text id="74100030">It is a kind of settlement...A place where life is almost normal.</text>
<text id="74100040">And in Drangleic these days,
there are very few places like that.</text>
<text>#0Talk-2nd time</text>
<text id="74100050">I am Saulden. And like you...
I lost everything, and now I'm here.</text>
<text id="74100060">You probably heard that
it was possible to break the curse here.</text>
<text id="74100070">Well, that's not true at all.</text>
<text id="74100080">There's nothing here,
for you, me, or anybody...</text>
<text>#0Talk-3rd time</text>
<text id="74100100">Do you know much about souls?</text>
<text id="74100110">Even I'm not certain, but...</text>
<text id="74100120">I'm told that the soul is the essence of life itself.</text>
<text id="74100130">Anything living, sentient or no, supposedly has one.</text>
<text id="74100140">What we call the curse
is traceable to the soul.</text>
<text id="74100150">Do you see what that means?</text>
<text id="74100160">To be alive...to walk this earth...
That's the real curse right there.</text>
<text id="74100170">We Undead will never die.</text>
<text id="74100180">And that's quite a predicament, really...</text>
<text>#0Talk-4th time</text>
<text id="74100200">There are four beings in this land with giant souls.</text>
<text id="74100210">And wherever you go from here,
you'll sooner or later come up against them.</text>
<text id="74100220">Each has a powerful soul, and a terrible curse...</text>
<text id="74100230">If that frightens you, then you ought to just give up right now.
Like I have.
Hah hah hah...</text>
<text>#0Talk-5th time</text>
<text id="74101200">Do you ever cry out for help?</text>
<text id="74101210">The journey of an Undead is long and treacherous.</text>
<text id="74101220">You'll face invaders
from other worlds at every turn.</text>
<text id="74101230">If you need help...
Why not proclaim faith in the Blue Sentinels?</text>
<text id="74101240">When you face danger,
the Blue Sentinels will come to your aid.</text>
<text id="74101250">Protection is yours, if you wish.
You need only accept their kind embrace.</text>
<text>#0Choose "No" to the query</text>
<text id="74101400">I see.
Then, you'll have to brave this
treacherous journey on your own.</text>
<text id="74101410">If you ever require help, come back any time.</text>
<text id="74101500">I will stay here, and pray for your safety.</text>
<text>#0Choose "Yes" to the query</text>
<text id="74101300">That is a wise decision.</text>
<text id="74101310">People are weak...
but the Blue Sentinels watch over us in their benevolence.</text>
<text id="74101320">Let the Sentinels cradle you in their embrace.</text>
<text>#0Talk-6th time</text>
<text id="74101600">You...need my help, do you?</text>
<text>#0Talk-7th time</text>
<text id="74101700">I will always be here...watching over you.</text>
<text>#0Talk-8th time</text>
<text id="74101800">Life is a journey...and ever journey eventually leads to home.</text>
<text>#0Menu-Choose "Talk" 1st time</text>
<text id="74100300">Do you see the way beyond the bonfire?
That will take you to the Forest of the Giants.</text>
<text id="74100310">There was once a great fort, but little of it remains.</text>
<text id="74100320">You may just find something there
that will be of use on your journey.</text>
<text id="74100330">But don't venture too far inside,
or you might not come back...</text>
<text>#0Menu-Choose "Talk" 2nd time</text>
<text id="74100400">Heide's Tower of Flame lies beyond the far gate.</text>
<text id="74100410">In the cathedral, the apostles of blue gather.</text>
<text id="74100420">But the road leading there is perilous.</text>
<text id="74100430">The gate is rigged with some contraption...</text>
<text id="74100440">But how it works, I just don't know...</text>
<text>#0Menu-Choose "Talk" 3rd time</text>
<text id="74100500">Have you seen that pit?
That gaping hole in the earth.</text>
<text id="74100520">I don't know what it's like down below,
but I wouldn't suggest trying to find out.</text>
<text id="74100530">Besides, you'll never make it down there,
not without a ladder of some sort.</text>
<text>#0Menu-Choose "Talk" 4th time</text>
<text id="74100800">The flame you see there is a bonfire.</text>
<text id="74100810">They exist all across the land... beacons to we Undead.</text>
<text id="74100820">If you are tired,
try resting beside the flame.</text>
<text id="74100830">The flame heals us.</text>
<text>#0Menu-Choose "Talk" 5th time</text>
<text id="74100900">Long ago, a woman called a Fire Keeper
watched over each bonfire.</text>
<text id="74100910">She kept the flame lit,
and guarded it from those who would extinguish it.</text>
<text id="74100920">I wonder where the Fire Keepers went...</text>
<text>#0Menu-Choose "Talk" 6th time</text>
<text id="74101000">Did you notice any letters
on the ground on the way here?</text>
<text id="74101010">These are messages that have
jumped the fissures between worlds.</text>
<text id="74101020">In Drangleic, the flow of time is convoluted.
Things shift and waver, twist and turn.</text>
<text id="74101030">Poignant wishes, dashed dreams...
The messages convey our very inner thoughts.</text>
<text id="74101040">If your will to soldier on falters, try leaving a message.
Somebody out there is sure to listen.</text>
<text>#0Menu-Choose "Talk" 7th time</text>
<text id="74101100">You may notice symbols that appear upon the ground.</text>
<text id="74101110">These are summon signatures...they call upon spirits
from other worlds through the schisms in time.</text>
<text id="74101120">If you fear Hollows,
find summon signatures to call upon spirits to help you.</text>
<text>#0Talk-After the 1st threshold of NPCs have relocated to Majula</text>
<text id="74108000">Do you feel lonely here?</text>
<text id="74108010">It suits me just fine, as I've nothing left anyway...</text>
<text id="74108020">It will grow on you, this place... Give it some time.</text>
<text>#0Talk-After the 2nd threshold of NPCs have relocated to Majula</text>
<text id="74108100">Look at our new neighbours...</text>
<text id="74108110">How they fret over all and sundry... Oh, those were better days.</text>
<text id="74108120">Oh dear me, it really takes me back.</text>
<text>#0Talk-After the 3rd threshold of NPCs have relocated to Majula</text>
<text id="74108200">Quite a hive of activity we are, these days.</text>
<text id="74108210">I'd forgotten how much comfort a little companionship can bring.</text>
<text id="74108220">Once, I'd lost everything, but now...</text>
<text id="74108230">I am grateful.
For what you have taught me.</text>
<text id="74108240">It is very little, but please, take this.</text>
<text>#0Talk-After the protagonist has died 100 times</text>
<text id="74107000">You have died many times, yes, I understand.</text>
<text id="74107010">Here, these are for you.</text>
<text id="74107020">May they help you on your travels.</text>
<text>#0Menu-Choose "Leave"</text>
<text id="74101900">May you find peace on your journey...</text>
<text>#0After leaving abruptly</text>
<text id="74102000">In a rush, are we?</text>
<text>#0Upon being attacked-1st time</text>
<text id="74105030">Ohgghh...ah!</text>
<text>#0Upon being attacked-2nd time</text>
<text id="74105040">Really now, stop that!</text>
<text>#0Upon being attacked-3rd time</text>
<text id="74105050">What on earth are you doing!</text>
<text>#0Upon being attacked &amp; made hostile</text>
<text id="74105000">Have you come unhinged?</text>
<text>#0Upon approaching him, after he has previously killed the protagonist</text>
<text id="74105010">Still flirting with madness?</text>
<text>#0Upon killing the protagonist</text>
<text id="74105020">How did this happen...</text>
<text>#0After reducing his health to 50% or lower</text>
<text id="74105060">What could possibly come of this?!</text>
<text>#0Upon dying</text>
<text id="74105070">Finally, I will have peace...</text>
<text id="74100600">##There lies a forest beyond the hills.</text>
<text id="74100610">##But I've never been out that way.
...It's far too perilous.</text>
<text id="74100620">##I am told the palace lies beyond the forest.</text>
<text id="74100630">##If there is any palace left at all,
after such a period of neglect.</text>
<text id="74100710">##Content to pray for the safety of brave travellers, like yourself.</text>
<text id="74106000">##I'll be moving on... I suppose...</text>
<text id="74100700">##(No caption) I shall remain... on this spot.</text>
