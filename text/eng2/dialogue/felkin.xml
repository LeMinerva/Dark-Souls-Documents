<text id="77000010">The frailty...of the weak... Disrupts the Dark...</text>
<text id="77000100">Leave me alone.</text>
<text id="77000110">I am interested in one thing. Dark.
You haven't the gift.</text>
<text id="77000200">The Dark stirs...</text>
<text id="77000210">I see...The Dark has sparked within you...</text>
<text id="77000220">My name is Felkin.</text>
<text id="77000230">I will trade with you. What do you need?</text>
<text id="77000400">You are...always welcome...yes...?</text>
<text id="77000500">The Dark...watches over you...</text>
<text id="77000600">Come again...as you like...</text>
<text id="77000610">The Dark...Is always within you...</text>
<text id="77000700">No matter...

<text id="77000800">Till we meet again.</text>
<text id="77000900">This land...lies closest to the Dark...
Th-that is...that is why I came here.</text>
<text id="77000910">This kingdom...collapsed long ago.</text>
<text id="77000920">All that are left... Are either Undead or Hollow...</text>
<text id="77000930">Save a few misfits like myself...hah hah.</text>
<text id="77001000">I w-went...I went...I went to a great school...in the south...
But neither sorcery nor pyromancy appealed...I...</text>
<text id="77001010">I-I learned nothing...nothing at all...
I-it was there that I happened upon the Dark.</text>
<text id="77001020">It drew me in... The nebulous Dark...</text>
<text id="77001030">Soon, I was drawn to this land,
where Dark runs deeper than anywhere else.</text>
<text id="77001100">Hexes originated in...ancient times.</text>
<text id="77001110">They were once...a form of sorcery.
But the practice was lost...then later rediscovered.</text>
<text id="77001120">Those devoted to hexes are a lonely lot...
But nevertheless...they give their lives to their art.</text>
<text id="77001130">Such is the fate...of we practitioners of Dark...</text>
<text id="77001200">What drew me to the Dark...I...I...I do not know.</text>
<text id="77001210">Hexes ar...are more than mere tools to me...</text>
<text id="77001220">I feel affinity...and warmth...
Something universal, nostalgia...even...</text>
<text id="77001230">Those who discover Dark...realise this...
And...they never come back.</text>
<text id="77005000">You've let Dark...take control...</text>
<text id="77005010">I cannot...let you have this.</text>
<text id="77005020">One day...I will share your fate.</text>
<text id="77005030">Hrk...</text>
<text id="77005040">What are you doing?</text>
<text id="77005050">Stop this.</text>
<text id="77005060">Ahhhh...ahh...my...my...Dark </text>
<text id="77005070">Look...the Dark...I see it...I see it...</text>
<text id="77006000">Dark...deliver me...</text>
