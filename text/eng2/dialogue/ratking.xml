<text id="75600000">Leave this place, human.</text>
<text id="75600010">We have no time for thy kind.</text>
<text id="75600020">Humans bring nothing but filth.</text>
<text id="75600100">Thy welcome wearest thin.</text>
<text id="75600110">Leave this place.</text>
<text id="75600200">Is that a Rat Tail,
human?</text>
<text id="75600210">Thou'st one of mine rat burrows conquered.
This will not go unnoticed.</text>
<text id="75600220">Rejoice,
for the right to serve me is now thine.</text>
<text id="75600230">Since thou'rt human still...</text>
<text id="75600240">Permit me ask. Wilt thou thy human soul surrender,
and pledge thyself to me?</text>
<text id="75600250">Swearest thou by the sweet-tempered sludge
that laps at our bosoms?</text>
<text id="75600300">Thou hast the eyes of one who perceiveth true beauty.</text>
<text id="75600310">Human, thou mayest serve.</text>
<text id="75600320">Take this ring.
It was forged by a human who was once among us.</text>
<text id="75600330">The ring draws to thee those who would defile our burrow.</text>
<text id="75600340">Wear the ring whenever thou'rt near.</text>
<text id="75600350">And destroy those who would dare provoke our ire.</text>
<text id="75600360">I will grant unto thee all thou should so desire.</text>
<text id="75600370">I prithee serve with a true rat's honour.</text>
<text id="75600400">Of course.
Humans are all alike.</text>
<text id="75600410">Get thee gone.
We will tolerate thy stench no longer.</text>
<text id="75600500">Thou return'st?</text>
<text id="75600510">I am not unkind. Shouldst thou forbear thy ways,
audience shall be thine.</text>
<text id="75600520">Swearest thou to serve me true?</text>
<text id="75600600">Then we need consort no longer.</text>
<text id="75600700">Speak thy mind, servant.</text>
<text id="75600800">My servant, tell me the way of things.</text>
<text id="75600810">There has been much honour in thy service,
despite the human blood coursing thy veins.</text>
<text id="75600820">I am merciful,
and trust in thee as I would any rat.</text>
<text id="75600900">The insolent fools line up to trample upon our burrows.</text>
<text id="75600910">My servant, dispatch these invaders,
and thy reward will be handsome indeed.</text>
<text id="75601000">Knowest thee of the Lockstones?
Those odd contraptions fashioned by human hand long ago.</text>
<text id="75601010">Thou art human, and thence able.</text>
<text id="75601020">I know thy kind, base plotters and schemers all.
Put these contraptions to thy employ 'gainst thy foe.</text>
<text id="75601100">Why comest thou here,
human?</text>
<text id="75601110">Thy treason will not go unpunished.</text>
<text id="75601120">Be gone.
I will gaze upon thee no longer.</text>
<text id="75601200">Traitors will not be forgiven.
Get thee gone.</text>
<text id="75601300">My servant, destroy my enemies.</text>
<text id="75601400">My servant, do not disappoint me.</text>
<text id="75601500">Go then, my servant.</text>
<text id="75601600">I am aware of thine accomplishments, and they are not few.</text>
<text id="75601610">Long ago, I struck an accord with a human chieftain.</text>
<text id="75601620">'Twas agreed, Humans would rule the lands
lapped by the sun's rays, and rats, all that was below.</text>
<text id="75601630">But humans are liars all, schemers and cheats.</text>
<text id="75601640">Thou art from a different cloth cut.
Do not disappoint me.</text>
<text id="75601700">Thy deeds are known to me.
Still, there is ever more work to be done.</text>
<text id="75601710">Humans are creatures of greed.
The time came they broke their word, and hunted us down.</text>
<text id="75601720">I had their word the underworld was ours to rule,
untouched as it is, by the rays of the sun.</text>
<text id="75601730">The more humans coveted,
the more blinded they became as to what truly mattered.</text>
<text id="75601740">And that is why I pity
the fools called humans.</text>
<text id="75601750">My servant,
human scent lingers upon thee yet.</text>
<text id="75601760">Rid thyself of it, if thou canst.</text>
<text id="75601800">My servant, well met indeed.</text>
<text id="75601810">'Twould seem some sunlight-poisoned creatures
are worthy of great honour.</text>
<text id="75601820">Thou'st permitted me to dream. One day,
rats and humans may yet live and die together, in peace.</text>
<text id="75605000">I will destroy thee,
filthy human!</text>
<text id="75605010">Thou art a fool to show thy face here!</text>
<text id="75605020">Disgusting creature...</text>
<text id="75605030">What is thy purpose?</text>
<text id="75605040">Enough of thy baseness.</text>
<text id="75605050">I've had quite enough.</text>
<text id="75606000">Adieu sweet burrow.</text>
