<text id="74400000">Hello there.
Travelling all alone in these treacherous times?</text>
<text id="74400010">Well, I hope you have a very good reason.</text>
<text id="74400020">Oh, hogwash, who am I to judge? Hah...</text>
<text id="74400030">My name is Pate.</text>
<text id="74400040">I journey hither and thither...
On a sort of...
...treasure hunt, you might call it.</text>
<text id="74400050">Be careful out there. There's talk of unsavoury bandits
who prey upon travellers like yourself.</text>
<text id="74400100">Oh yes,
you be cautious if you go any farther.</text>
<text id="74400110">There's treasure in there, for certain,
but the entrance locks from behind.</text>
<text id="74400120">I saw the same design earlier,
and it's the same contraption, I'm sure.</text>
<text id="74400130">I was with this warrior, you see,
and he insisted that he go inside first.</text>
<text id="74400140">The rather brusque fellow tried to swipe the loot for himself,
but it trapped him inside.</text>
<text id="74400150">I still have the gent's ring.
I do hope he wasn't harmed.</text>
<text id="74400200">I'll leave this one to you.
I'm worried about what might be inside.</text>
<text id="74400300">Well, I see you managed to escape.</text>
<text id="74400310">I hope that brave warrior didn't come a cropper either.</text>
<text id="74400320">Be careful out there. There's talk of unsavoury bandits
who prey upon travellers like yourself.</text>
<text id="74400330">##There's a right foul creature lurking this way.
I'd say, why disturb the thing?</text>
<text id="74400340">##But if you must go on, I'm not one to stop you.</text>
<text id="74400350">Oh, but you should take this.</text>
<text id="74400360">It allows Undead to call out for help to one another,
across the fissures between worlds.</text>
<text id="74400370">With luck,
somebody will lend you a hand.</text>
<text id="74400380">##I wish I were more help myself,
but I haven't much bravery in me.
Heh heh...</text>
<text id="74400500">##Well, that was a close call! Heh heh...</text>
<text id="74400510">I wanted to warn you of the trap down the way,
but you walked right past me.</text>
<text id="74400520">My name is Pate.</text>
<text id="74400530">I journey hither and thither...
On a sort of...
...treasure hunt, you might call it.</text>
<text id="74400540">Be careful out there. There's talk of unsavoury bandits
who prey upon travellers like yourself.</text>
<text id="74400700">Good to see you safe.</text>
<text id="74400800">Well, we meet again.</text>
<text id="74400810">There's treasure this way...
But I've a bad feeling about it.</text>
<text id="74400830">I don't quite have the guts myself! Hah hah...</text>
<text id="74400900">Well, good to see that you survived.</text>
<text id="74400910">Perhaps you're more rugged than I thought.</text>
<text id="74400920">In any case, the treasure is yours.
Since you went ahead, and took the leap.</text>
<text id="74401000">I prefer a more cautious approach.
It's hard to know who to even trust these days.</text>
<text id="74401010">For instance, I've heard that a man is out for my life.</text>
<text id="74401020">Now, what misunderstanding could have ever led to that?</text>
<text id="74401030">The poor bloke must have quite an imagination. Heh...</text>
<text id="74401100">You be careful, too, my friend.
For trust can be a dangerous thing.</text>
<text id="74401200">He swung at me! Please, lend me a hand!</text>
<text id="74401300">What misunderstanding could have caused this?</text>
<text id="74401310">Well. Thank you.
I owe you my life.</text>
<text id="74401320">My little pied-à-terre lies beyond here.</text>
<text id="74401330">You'll find some of my treasures there.
Help yourself to those that suit you.</text>
<text id="74401340">Here, use this key.</text>
<text id="74401400">Be cautious on your travels.</text>
<text id="74401500">What was he thinking?</text>
<text id="74401510">I haven't done a thing.</text>
<text id="74401600">Ooh, that'll leave a nice scar!</text>
<text id="74405000">Oh, I can scrimmage, my friend.</text>
<text id="74405010">You again? Oh, heavens...</text>
<text id="74405020">Heh heh heh...</text>
<text id="74405030">Eek!</text>
<text id="74405040">What the devil's...!</text>
<text id="74405050">Now, stop that!</text>
<text id="74405060">Not too shabby... Heh heh...</text>
<text id="74405070">Aiieeegh!</text>
<text id="74406000">Heh heh heh...</text>
<text id="74407000">We went through a lot together.
Take these, as a token of our friendship.</text>
<text id="74407010">Don't be shy,
they were meant for you...
Heh heh...</text>
