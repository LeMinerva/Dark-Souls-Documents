<text>#0After approaching the entrance to Eleum Loyce</text>
<text id="75810010">You, approaching Eleum Loyce,</text>
<text id="75810011">Turn back.</text>
<text id="75810012">The old Chaos hungers still.</text>
<text>#0After approaching the mist gate before Aava, the King's Pet</text>
<text id="75810030">Go back.</text>
<text id="75810031">Aava is watching.</text>
<text id="75810032">Go back.</text>
<text>#0After entering the mist gate &amp; approaching Aava, the King's Pet</text>
<text id="75810040">Poor Aava,
do you miss your king?</text>
<text id="75810041">One without the sign has arrived.</text>
<text id="75810042">Do be merciful,
and end things swiftly.</text>
<text>#0After approaching the Eye of the Priestess</text>
<text id="75810050">Turn away.</text>
<text id="75810051">And never look back.</text>
<text id="75810052">No one must ever find that
which is sheltered in Eleum Loyce.</text>
<text>#0After acquiring the Eye of the Priestess &amp; approaching Aava, the King's Pet</text>
<text id="75810013">This dead city has nothing to offer.</text>
<text id="75810014">Go back.</text>
<text id="75810015">Do not seek the old Chaos,
nor its twisted flame.</text>
<text>#0Talk-1st time</text>
<text id="75810110">To think Aava could be bested...</text>
<text id="75810111">Who are you?</text>
<text>#0Talk-After restoring all Loyce Knights</text>
<text id="75810120">The frozen knights of Eleum Loyce.</text>
<text id="75810121">You have restored their purpose.</text>
<text id="75810122">Who are you, truly?</text>
<text>#0Talk-2nd time</text>
<text id="75810130">This land is barren,</text>
<text id="75810131">Cursed, by the old Chaos.</text>
<text id="75810132">It gave birth to atrocities, and the people fled in fear.</text>
<text id="75810133">Until our lord, the Ivory King, came.</text>
<text>#0Talk-3rd time</text>
<text id="75810140">My dear lord, a most true king.</text>
<text id="75810141">It was with his magnificent soul
that he built Eleum Loyce...</text>
<text id="75810142">...and contained the spread of Chaos.</text>
<text id="75810143">But the Chaos would not be sated,
and the King gave his own soul.</text>
<text>#0Talk-4th time</text>
<text id="75810150">Inevitably, the King was drained of vigour,
and plunged into the Chaos' heart.</text>
<text id="75810151">Eleum Loyce was frozen in time, its leader lost...</text>
<text id="75810152">I remain here, to contain the Chaos, honouring my Lord's wishes.</text>
<text id="75810153">Perhaps one day, he will return...</text>
<text id="75810154">I will stay here, until I wither away...</text>
<text id="75810155">There is nothing here,
save that accursed flame...</text>
<text>#0Talk-5th time</text>
<text id="75810160">I have but one wish.</text>
<text id="75810161">That my dear Lord might be freed
from that unspeakable Chaos.</text>
<text id="75810162">I haven't the strength to help him myself,
but perhaps one such as you...</text>
<text id="75810163">Though I am yet to know your name, stranger,
will you lend me your strength?</text>
<text>#0Choose "No" to either the 1st or 2nd query</text>
<text id="75810180">Then be gone.</text>
<text id="75810181">There is nothing here, nothing at all.</text>
<text>#0Talk-After choosing "No" to the query</text>
<text id="75810190">Stranger.</text>
<text id="75810191">Are you now prepared to plunge into Chaos?</text>
<text>#0Choose "Yes" to either the 1st or 2nd query</text>
<text id="75810170">Kind visitor, I thank you.</text>
<text id="75810171">Let me open the path to Chaos.</text>
<text id="75810172">And please, do all you can...</text>
<text>#0Talk-After choosing "Yes" to either the 1st or 2nd query</text>
<text id="75810210">Many of Eleum Loyce's faithful knights
followed their Lord into the Chaos.</text>
<text id="75810211">But not one of them returned.</text>
<text id="75810212">The King's dutiful subjects waited patiently for His homecoming.</text>
<text id="75810213">But it was too long a wait to bear...</text>
<text id="75810214">The knights of Eleum Loyce await a new leader.</text>
<text id="75810215">One who will guide them into Chaos.</text>

<text id="75810200">Many of Eleum Loyce's faithful knights

<text id="75810203">But it was too long a wait to bear...</text>
<text id="75810204">The knights, reborn, will follow your word.</text>
<text>#0Talk-1st time after defeating the Burnt Ivory King</text>
<text id="75810300">You've granted my one wish...</text>
<text id="75810301">Now, I have no regrets.</text>
<text id="75810302">I was born amidst the Dark.</text>
<text id="75810303">Long ago, in the depths of the Abyss, my Father perished.</text>
<text id="75810304">The Dark shattered into tiny pieces,
one of which was me.</text>
<text id="75810305">How frightened I was. A frail thing,
born from but a splinter of Dark.</text>
<text id="75810306">I felt that I might simply disappear.</text>
<text id="75810307">I am, in fact,
the incarnation of my Father's fears.</text>
<text id="75810308">I sought an anchor, and I saw that the King of this land was strong.</text>
<text id="75810309">I sought him only to sustain myself, to smother my fears...</text>
<text id="75810310">Now, I realise that he may have known all along.</text>
<text id="75810311">I was born of fear, and my Lord provided comfort.</text>
<text id="75810312">And so here I remain, heiress to my Lord's wishes,
watching over Chaos...</text>
<text id="75810313">...until the end of time.</text>
<text id="75810314">...until I wither away.</text>
<text>#0Talk-2nd time after defeating the Burnt Ivory King</text>
<text id="75810320">The knights of Eleum Loyce were swallowed by the Chaos...</text>
<text id="75810321">...where their souls still remain.</text>
<text id="75810322">I pray for their deliverance...</text>

<text id="75810331">Kind visitor,
please accept my gratitude.</text>
<text>#0Talk-2nd time after giving her 5 Loyce Knight Souls</text>
<text id="75810340">My dear Lord has departed.</text>
<text id="75810341">I am left only to fend off the Chaos,
and pray with all my heart.</text>
<text id="75810342">For my dear Lord, and his loyal knights.</text>

<text id="75810360">The beings born from shards of Dark...</text>
<text id="75810361">I am not the only one.</text>
<text id="75810362">Even Dark seeks solace, and more so, souls.</text>
<text id="75810363">Magnificent souls...like your own...</text>

<text>#0Talk-2nd time after giving her 35 Loyce Knight Souls</text>
<text id="75810380">My Father, once human, succumbed to Dark...</text>
<text id="75810381">And later, set in motion its raging advance.</text>
<text id="75810382">The Dark wanders, guided by its thirst for souls.
But perhaps...</text>
<text id="75810383">...man is no different.</text>

<text id="75810392">You will face hardship like no other.</text>
<text id="75810393">Take this.</text>
<text id="75810394">My sisters are as a thick Dark, their lust for souls insatiable...</text>
<text id="75810395">May you find the will to resist their desires...</text>
<text>#0Talk-3rd time after giving her 50 Loyce Knight Souls</text>
<text id="75810396">Go on, kind visitor.</text>
<text id="75810397">May you reach your journey's end, one day.</text>
