<text id="70500000">Heh heh heh...
What seems to be the ruckus?</text>
<text id="70500010">Ooh, my! Your face.</text>
<text id="70500020">The face of the curse.</text>
<text id="70500030">It's an Undead.</text>
<text id="70500040">An Undead has come to play.
Heh heh...</text>
<text id="70500050">You've seen the mark upon your flesh.</text>
<text id="70500060">The sign of the Undead...symbol of the accursed.</text>
<text id="70500070">They all end up here,
all the ones like you.</text>
<text id="70500080">You spoke to that kind old dear, 
didn't you? 
Heh heh...</text>
<text id="70500100">You're finished.</text>
<text id="70500110">Your flesh will decay, your mind will fade.
But you won't ever die.</text>
<text id="70500120">You'll go Hollow.</text>
<text id="70500130">Yes, you will become one of them.</text>
<text id="70500140">Hollows prey upon men,
feast upon their souls.</text>
<text id="70500150">This is the fate of the cursed. Heh heh heh...</text>
<text id="70500170">What is your name?</text>
<text id="70500180">Surely you can tell me your name.</text>
<text id="70500190">If you remember it, that is.
Heh heh...</text>
<text id="70500200">At least you know your own name.</text>
<text id="70500210">Here's your reward for sharing.</text>
<text id="70500220">It's a Human Effigy.</text>
<text id="70500230">Take a closer look...</text>
<text id="70500240">Who do you think it's supposed to be?</text>
<text id="70500250">It's somebody that
you know very well.</text>
<text id="70500260">Go on, look closer, closer still.</text>
<text id="70500270">Think back, deep into your past.</text>
<text id="70500280">Yes, it's an effigy of you.</text>
<text id="70500290">All people come here for the same reason.</text>
<text id="70500300">To break the curse.</text>
<text id="70500310">You're no different, I should think?</text>
<text id="70500320">Hmm...
doesn't stand a chance.</text>
<text id="70500330">Well, you never know!</text>
<text id="70500350">Now, it's just about our bedtime.</text>
<text id="70500360">Go through the door and trot along to the kingdom.</text>
<text id="70500370">Go on, out the door.</text>
<text id="70500380">But remember, hold on to your souls.</text>
<text id="70500390">They're all that keep you from going Hollow.</text>
<text id="70500400">Oh, I'll fool you no longer...</text>
<text id="70500410">You'll lose your souls... All of them. Over and over again.</text>
<text id="70501000">You must go, on a journey without rest.</text>
<text id="70501010">Well...I suppose, if you find yourself at an impasse...</text>
<text id="70501020">But if your will is yet unbroken,
then you may return here.</text>
<text id="70501030">To start again, with a clean slate...</text>
<text id="70501040">Hah hah hah...</text>
<text id="70501100">Now, go along, go along...
Heh heh...</text>
<text id="70501200">Still determined as ever, I see...
Heh heh...</text>
<text id="70501210">Do you wish to start all over again?</text>
<text id="70501300">No, of course not.</text>
<text id="70501310">Now, go along then...
Heh heh...</text>
<text id="70501400">Oh, but you don't have what's needed.</text>
<text id="70501410">Well, that won't do at all!</text>
<text id="70501420">Go along, then.
Old hags don't bargain, dearie...
Heh heh...</text>
<text id="70501500">Now, go along.</text>
<text id="70501510">On a journey without rest.
Heh heh...</text>
<text id="70501600">...</text>
<text id="70505000">A touch under the weather,
are we?</text>
<text id="70505010">Hah hah hah...</text>
<text id="70505030">Hah hah...</text>
<text id="70505040">Be nice...</text>
<text id="70505050">Tisn't easy
being old...</text>
<text id="70505070">Hah hah hah...</text>
<text id="70506000">Hah hah hah...</text>
<text id="70507000">Still holding up, are you?</text>
<text id="70507010">Go on, take these.
Heh heh...</text>
<text id="70511000">Hah hah hah...</text>
<text id="70511100">...</text>
