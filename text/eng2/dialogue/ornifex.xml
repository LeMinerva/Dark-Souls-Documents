<text>#0Talk-1st time, after opening the door she is behind with the Fang Key</text>
<text id="77500101">Thank you for helping me.</text>
<text id="77500110">I am Ornifex.</text>
<text id="77500120">I owe you some form of thanks,
but have nothing for you at the moment.</text>
<text id="77500130">If it would not trouble you,
could you visit my abode just down the way?</text>
<text>#0Talk-2nd time</text>
<text id="77500200">Thank you, kind traveller.</text>
<text id="77500210">I believe that I can be of assistance
if you would visit me at my home.</text>
<text>#0Talk-1st time</text>
<text id="77500300">Oh, we meet again, kind traveller.</text>
<text id="77500310">This is my workshop.</text>
<text id="77500320">In your tongue,
I believe I would be called a blacksmith.</text>
<text id="77500330">I create all manner of equipment,
using an ancient technique unique to my...people.</text>
<text id="77500350">Normally I only cater to a very select few...</text>
<text id="77500360">But I have a debt to you.
I will craft one thing of your choice.</text>
<text id="77500380">My wares are
far from ordinary.</text>
<text id="77500390">I am certain that they will please you.</text>
<text id="77500400">I require no payment this time.
But you must bring me a Wondrous Soul.</text>
<text id="77500410">My technique absolutely requires it.
I trust you will understand.</text>
<text>#0Talk-2nd time, before trading a Wondrous Soul</text>
<text id="77500510">If you provide a Wondrous Soul,
I will create one thing of your choice.</text>
<text id="77500530">I require no payment this time.
It is my way of saying thanks.</text>
<text>#0Talk-3rd time</text>
<text id="77501400">What do you desire?</text>
<text>#0Talk-4th time</text>
<text id="77501500">Do you have a Wondrous Soul?</text>
<text>#0Talk-1st time after resting at a Bonfire</text>
<text id="77501600">Hello there.
Do you have a Wondrous Soul?</text>
<text>#0Talk-2nd time after resting at a Bonfire</text>
<text id="77501700">Hello there.
What can I do for you?</text>
<text>#0Menu-Choose "Talk" 1st time</text>
<text id="77501300">The nature of an item is greatly influenced
by the soul that was used to create it.</text>
<text id="77501310">They can be tricky to use,
but when wielded properly, are extremely powerful.</text>
<text id="77501320">This is what I meant by unique.
These wares are not for use by ordinary folk.</text>
<text>#0Menu-Choose "Talk" 2nd time</text>
<text id="77502400">It's hard to believe now,
but this land was once a flourishing kingdom.</text>
<text id="77502410">Its king, Vendrick,
came close to unlocking the essence of the soul.</text>
<text id="77502420">What a dazzling soul he surely had...</text>
<text id="77502430">Imagine what I might create with such a powerful soul...</text>
<text>#0Menu-Choose "Talk" 3rd time</text>
<text id="77502500">It is said that our technique originates
from a strange being that inhabited this land.</text>
<text id="77502510">A pale beast that lived long, long ago.
We don't even know what exactly it was.</text>
<text id="77502520">If you find a Wondrous Soul,
bring it by for me to have a look.</text>
<text>#0Menu-Choose "Talk" 4th time</text>
<text id="77502600">Do you find me strange? Skee hee.</text>
<text id="77502610">You humans are always this way.
The way you glare at any unfamiliar creature.</text>
<text id="77502620">That mix of curiosity, fear, and revulsion.</text>
<text id="77502630">Oh, well. It hardly concerns me.</text>
<text>#0Menu-Choose "Leave"</text>
<text id="77502200">Come back again if you find another soul.</text>
<text>#0Menu-Choose "Leave" after purchasing something</text>
<text id="77501100">Come again, if it please you.</text>
<text>#0After leaving abruptly</text>
<text id="77502300">Be safe.</text>

<text id="77505030">Skwaa!</text>
<text>#0Upon being attacked-2nd time</text>
<text id="77505040">What are you...!</text>
<text>#0Upon being attacked-3rd time</text>
<text id="77505050">Stop this!</text>
<text>#0Upon being attacked &amp; made hostile</text>
<text id="77505000">Oh, as you please...</text>
<text>#0Upon approaching her, after she has previously killed the protagonist</text>
<text id="77505010">You again?</text>
<text>#0Upon killing the protagonist</text>
<text id="77505020">What a bother.</text>
<text>#0Upon dying</text>
<text id="77505070">You humans are all alike...</text>
<text id="77500100">##Thank you for helping me.
How awkward...that I fell for such a trap.</text>
<text id="77506000">##May we meet again.</text>
<text id="77509000">##(No caption) Could you lend me a hand?</text>
<text id="77509100">##(No caption) You can trust me, I assure you.</text>
