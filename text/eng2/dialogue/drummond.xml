<text id="72400000">What are you doing here?</text>
<text id="72400010">You are not one of our soldiers.
And I don't take you for a mercenary.</text>
<text id="72400020">Whoever you are, this is no battle to involve yourself in.</text>
<text id="72400030">Whether you are guided by bravery,
or brashness, this is no place for you. </text>
<text id="72400100">I am Drummond,
and the Lord has placed this fort in my hands.</text>
<text id="72400110">Whoever you are, I forgive your trespass.
But leave this place immediately.</text>
<text id="72400120">Just mention my name, and no man will challenge your exit.</text>
<text id="72400130">And even if you don't, by now,
my men have not the will to resist.</text>
<text id="72400200">Soon, the Giants will descend upon this fort.</text>
<text id="72400210">It is revenge,
for the Kingdom's misguided barbarism.</text>
<text id="72400220">The venerable Lord built this kingdom
to bring prosperity to His subjects.</text>
<text id="72400230">What has transformed him so, I can not imagine.</text>
<text id="72400300">Long ago, the King crossed the seas,
pillaged the land of Giants, and brought back a "prize".</text>
<text id="72400310">It was then that the golems materialised.</text>
<text id="72400320">The Giants are no ordinary barbarians.
A singular rage burns within their hearts.</text>
<text id="72400330">My father, and his father,
both fought the Giants on this very land.</text>
<text id="72400340">The Giants have wills of steel.</text>
<text id="72400350">They cannot find it within themselves...
To forgive the misdeeds of our lord.</text>
<text id="72400400">Did you see him? That towering monster among them.</text>
<text id="72400410">That is most certainly their King.</text>
<text id="72400420">He will be a thing to topple,
hah hah hah hah, even if I should die trying!</text>
<text id="72400430">My blade may break, my arrows fall wide,
but my will shall never be broken.</text>
<text id="72400440">Those who live by the sword will die by it,
and I, Drummond, won't go down without drawing mine!</text>
<text id="72400500">Be gone with you, this fort will soon fall.</text>
<text id="72400510">Be gone, before the Giants are entirely upon us.</text>
<text id="72405000">You dare to mock me!</text>
<text id="72405010">Are you determined to die?</text>
<text id="72405020">What a waste.</text>
<text id="72405030">Erg!</text>
<text id="72405040">How dare you!</text>
<text id="72405050">Enough with this madness!</text>
<text id="72405060">Hmph! How very sporting!</text>
<text id="72405070">I..I am...bested...</text>
<text id="72406000">##Matters are settled...</text>
<text id="72407000">Take these.
I think you may just need them.</text>
<text id="72407010">Don't ask me why.
I just do.</text>
