<text id="72500000">Ahh, look how far this Undead has wandered.</text>
<text id="72500010">And a very fit Undead you are.</text>
<text id="72500020">A bit too alive, but with a darkish shadow.
Yet still unprepared. For a deeper Dark.</text>
<text id="72500030">And like every Undead, you have no future.</text>
<text id="72500040">Ooh, my, don't mind me.
I'm just talking amongst myself.</text>
<text id="72500050">But if you find a need for a truer Dark, then meet again, we shall.</text>

then we will surely meet again.</text>

<text id="72500400">We meet again,
young Undead.</text>
<text id="72500410">You have the look of a true seeker.</text>
<text id="72500420">I am Darkdiver Grandahl,
seeker of Dark, giver of Dark.</text>
<text id="72500430">If you seek true Dark, I will grant it to you.
As much as you desire.</text>
<text id="72500440">Well, then... Is Dark what you wish for?</text>

Dark you can endure.</text>
