<text id="30700000">Leave me be.</text>
<text id="30700010">I like it quiet.
Leave me be.</text>
<text id="30700100">What business have you here, traveller?</text>
<text id="30700110">You may call me Vengarl.
If I deserve a name, in this sorry state.</text>
<text id="30700120">'Tis rare to flap these gums.
This is pleasant. </text>
<text id="30700200">Long ago, I was hired to defend the kingdom.</text>
<text id="30700210">I remember a long, brutal fight, and then...
Somebody killed me. Or so I thought...</text>
<text id="30700220">I came to, and found myself like this.</text>
<text id="30700230">I don't know what explains it,
but it's not so bad, really.</text>
<text id="30700240">And now I watch the days go by, and gaze at the night sky,
thinking of the finer things, far removed from war.</text>
<text id="30700250">I'd grown weary of battle,
but did not realise it until now.</text>
<text id="30700300">I know not what brings you on this journey,
nor will I deign to ask.</text>
<text id="30700310">You may bear a great burden, but don't we all?
I prefer to stay my distance.</text>
<text id="30700320">But I want to warn you of something.
My body.</text>
<text id="30700330">I see visions; my body, headless,
raging without me.</text>
<text id="30700340">My body, wielding my sword,
a sword forged only to kill.</text>
<text id="30700350">My body will show no mercy.
If you see the wretched thing, stay far away.</text>
<text id="30700400">I learn new things every day.
Things never learned in battle.</text>
<text id="30700410">And, thanks to you,
I've recalled the joy of conversation.</text>
<text id="30700420">If I can help you,
if you require something, do speak up.</text>
<text id="30700500">Farewell.
May we meet again, one day soon.</text>
<text id="30700600">Farewell.
I will retire to my silence.</text>
<text id="30700700">Safe travels, then...</text>
<text id="30700800">Back again?
Well, this is a pleasant surprise.</text>
<text id="30700900">Ah, it was you,
who vanquished my body.</text>
<text id="30700910">It is my body, you see,
and I can sense what happens to it.</text>
<text id="30700920">I do not mourn for it.
Good riddance! </text>
<text id="30700930">If you wish for help, summon me.
I am rusty in battle, but will fight by your side.</text>
<text id="30701000">I cannot lie.
Sometimes I wonder what's become of the kingdom.</text>
<text id="30701010">I was a hired hand, yes,
but we soldiers stared death in the eye together.</text>
<text id="30701020">And for His Highness...
I am afraid...</text>
<text id="30701030">But, perhaps it is for the best.
We knew not what we fought for.</text>
<text id="30701100">I was born in Forossa.
It's a land in the distant east.</text>
<text id="30701110">When I was born,
we were already mired in prolonged conflict with our neighbours.</text>
<text id="30701120">Eventually, our kingdom fell, and our people scattered. </text>
<text id="30701130">I've been a sellsword ever since.</text>
<text id="30701140">All I ever knew was war, and I can imagine no other way to live.</text>
<text id="30701150">What a fool I was.</text>
<text id="30701200">I am grateful for these peaceful days.</text>
<text id="30701210">But such contentment lies only in the here and now.</text>
<text id="30701220">Why must life be so confounding...</text>
<text id="30705000">You fiend!</text>
<text id="30705010">There you are...!</text>
<text id="30705030">Hrgoah!</text>
<text id="30705040">How dare you!</text>
<text id="30705050">A murderer now, are you?</text>
<text id="30705060">As you wish.</text>
<text id="30705070">Life goes on...</text>
<text id="30706000">##I like quiet. It's all I ever wished for.</text>
<text id="30707000">Thank you, for lending an ear to my ramblings.</text>
<text id="30707010">Here, take these. I have no use for them.</text>
<text id="30707020">Go along, and resume your journey.</text>
