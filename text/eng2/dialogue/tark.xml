<text id="50209998">...!</text>
<text>#0Talk-1st time, With Ring of Whispers Equipped</text>
<text id="50200000">Human, are we?</text>
<text id="50200010">This is no place for you.
Be gone.</text>
<text>#0Talk-2nd time</text>
<text id="50200100">Are you not afraid of me?</text>
<text id="50200110">Humans rarely come here.</text>
<text id="50200120">Those who do turn back when they see me.
Or make an attempt on my life.</text>
<text id="50200130">But you, heh...
are different. </text>
<text>#0Talk-3rd time</text>
<text id="50200200">We once had a master.
He created us long, long ago.</text>
<text id="50200210">But he was born with a fatal flaw.</text>
<text id="50200220">He resented those who had what he lacked,
and became fully mired in hatred.</text>
<text id="50200230">Eventually, he drove himself mad.</text>
<text id="50200240">It was at the peak of this madness
that he conjured up we strange creatures.</text>
<text>#0Talk-4th time</text>
<text id="50200300">Our master was a tragically lonely soul.</text>
<text id="50200310">Eventually, his solitude eroded his very reason.</text>
<text id="50200320">In the end,
he never understood...</text>
<text id="50200330">...what it was that he truly lacked.</text>
<text>#0Talk-5th time</text>
<text id="50200400">Nobody knows when we were born.</text>
<text id="50200410">Or where our master has gone.</text>
<text id="50200420">The only ones who even speak a human tongue
are myself and my better half.</text>
<text>#0Talk-6th time</text>
<text id="50200500">I wish to ask a favour of you.
I want you to kill my betrothed.</text>
<text id="50200510">Once, I always found her at my side.
 But as time went on, things went awry.</text>
<text id="50200520">She became violent, raging uncontrollably.</text>
<text id="50200530">Eventually she came after me.</text>
<text id="50200540">And we've been locked
in combat ever since.</text>
<text>#0Talk-7th time</text>
<text id="50200600">We seem to be at a standstill.
The wounds we exchange are never lethal.</text>
<text id="50200610">I was born of my master's madness.
Perhaps this is some curse.</text>
<text id="50200620">I will be sure to assist you in return.</text>
<text>#0Talk-8th time</text>
<text id="50200710">The past is a distant fog...</text>
<text id="50200720">My name was Tark... That is all that I remember...</text>
<text>#0Talk-1st time, after defeating Scorpioness Najka</text>
<text id="50201000">You've defeated my better half.</text>
<text id="50201010">This is my thanks.
Take it.</text>
<text>#0Talk-2nd time, after defeating Scorpioness Najka</text>
<text id="50201100">Long ago, there was a being with powers similar to ours.</text>
<text id="50201110">The creature took the form of a spider.</text>
<text id="50201120">But I don't know where it disappeared to.</text>
<text id="50201130">Perhaps it was seduced by madness.</text>
<text>#0Talk-3rd time, after defeating Scorpioness Najka</text>
<text id="50201200">I have no gods to pray to.</text>
<text id="50201210">But still I pray that your journey will be safe.</text>
<text>#0Talk-1st time, after defeating The Duke's Dear Freja</text>
<text id="50207000">What skill.
You've defeated my master.</text>
<text id="50207010">But our master never dies, only changes form,
so that he may seethe for all eternity.</text>
<text id="50207020">Brave human, you have yet to face your greatest perils.</text>
<text id="50207030">Take these.
May joy await you at the end of your travels.</text>

<text>#0Upon being attacked-2nd time</text>
<text id="50205040">What are you doing!</text>
<text>#0Upon being attacked-3rd time</text>
<text id="50205050">How dare you!</text>
<text>#0Upon being attacked &amp; made hostile</text>
<text id="50205000">Have you been enslaved by madness?</text>
<text>#0Upon approaching him, after he has previously killed the protagonist</text>
<text id="50205010">The mad will never be forgiven.</text>
<text>#0Upon killing the protagonist</text>
<text id="50205020">Foolish human...</text>
<text>#0After reducing his health to 50% or lower</text>
<text id="50205060">You wretched human!</text>
<text>#0Upon dying</text>
<text id="50205070">Arrggh...</text>
<text id="50200700">##Since I speak the tongue of men,
does this mean I was once human?</text>
