<text id="75100000">Oh, I'm sorry.
I was just...daydreaming, I think.</text>
<text id="75100010">My name is Cale.
I am a traveller, like yourself.</text>
<text id="75100020">I'm navigating the continent to create a map.</text>
<text id="75100100">Why cartography, you ask?</text>
<text id="75100110">Well...that's a good question...</text>
<text id="75100120">When I first came to this forsaken land...</text>
<text id="75100130">...It was...um...hmm...?</text>
<text id="75100140">Err...a curse...? Err...something about a curse...</text>
<text id="75100150">Hah hah... How embarrasing.
I seem to have lost my focus. </text>
<text id="75100160">But I do know one thing for certain.
I have always been very fond of maps.</text>
<text id="75100200">I came to this land some time ago.</text>
<text id="75100210">Drangleic, the lost kingdom... It sounded so romantic...</text>
<text id="75100220">Have you seen Majula?
There's a rather spacious mansion there.</text>
<text id="75100230">I...I've made it my temporary home.
A...As something of a squatter, I'm afraid.</text>
<text id="75100300">Inside the mansion, I found a strange map.
Like none I'd ever seen.</text>
<text id="75100310">I believe that it's a map of Drangleic.</text>
<text id="75100320">Now I'm travelling the land to prove it.</text>
<text id="75100330">Yes, yes, that's it! That's why I came to the kingdom!</text>
<text id="75100340">Wait...No, that wasn't it...</text>
<text id="75100350">Then what? I don't seem to recall...</text>
<text id="75100400">Were you looking for that map?</text>
<text id="75100410">Wonderful!
Then you're fascinated by maps,
just like me?!</text>
<text id="75100420">Shame on you,
you should have told me before!</text>
<text id="75100430">Here, take this!
A key to the mansion!</text>
<text id="75100440">What a joy to meet a kindred spirit out here...</text>
<text id="75100500">Incredible really, isn't it?
Such a map, to be chiselled in stone...</text>
<text id="75100510">Oh, but one thing...</text>
<text id="75100520">I would not venture deep into the mansion.</text>
<text id="75100530">I can't be certain, but... I've heard disturbing noises...</text>
<text id="75100540">Something about it feels wrong... Just be careful, please.</text>
<text id="75100600">I'll be back in Majula soon.</text>
<text id="75100610">Perhaps we will meet again,
and discuss maps at our leisure!</text>
<text id="75100700">Oh! Hello again!</text>
<text id="75100710">You've made it. The map, I presume?</text>
<text id="75100720">Of course, take a good look!</text>
<text id="75100800">Did you see the flame on the map?</text>
<text id="75100810">It wasn't there when I came here before.</text>
<text id="75100820">I don't know what explains it...</text>
<text id="75100900">But there is something
greatly comforting about that flame.</text>
<text id="75100910">It seems to fulfil something very precious,
deep within the soul...</text>
<text id="75100920">Something...essential...</text>
<text id="75101000">I would not venture far into that hole.</text>
<text id="75101010">It was blocked by a wall,
something built long ago.</text>
<text id="75101020">But it was crumbling, and I finished the job.
Now a foul sound echoes within...</text>
<text id="75101100">Even more flames have appeared.</text>
<text id="75101110">I don't know what causes it.</text>
<text id="75101200">It seems that all the flames have been lit.</text>
<text id="75101210">It makes me feel...somehow...</text>
<text id="75101220">Wait! What...am I doing here?</text>
<text id="75101230">Who are you again?</text>
<text id="75101300">Ah yes, there is something I wanted to tell you.</text>
<text id="75101310">I was born in the land of Mirrah.</text>
<text id="75101320">Mirrah is also the home of an infamous killer,
a 'knight' in name alone.</text>
<text id="75101330">He was locked in the dungeon for multiple murders.
But shortly before his execution, he managed to escape.</text>
<text id="75101340">And the other day...
I saw a fellow with a striking likeness! And then!</text>
<text id="75101350">And then... Wait...</text>
<text id="75101360">Well...I think he looked rather similar...</text>
<text id="75101370">N-no, it's true! I saw just such a man, I swear!</text>
<text id="75101380">I believe his name was...Cr...Cr...err Cray-something...I believe...</text>
<text id="75101390">They shared...some resemblance, I...I think...</text>
<text id="75105000">I shan't die here!</text>
<text id="75105010">Shoo, go away!</text>
<text id="75105020">Are you...all right?</text>
<text id="75105030">Argh!</text>
<text id="75105040">Watch it!</text>
<text id="75105050">Stop that!</text>
<text id="75105060">How could you!</text>
<text id="75105070">My...my map...</text>
<text id="75106000">##That map...It's spellbinding...</text>
<text id="75107000">Fate brought us together for a reason.</text>
<text id="75107010">Take these. And may they help you on your travels.</text>
