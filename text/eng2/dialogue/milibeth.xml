<text id="72300000">##That was dangerously close.</text>
<text id="72300010">This is a limbo.
A link between Drangleic and the outer world.</text>
<text id="72300020">Fair traveller, I know that you must have a story.</text>
<text id="72300030">Why else would you visit such a place?</text>
<text id="72300040">This lost, decayed kingdom.</text>
<text id="72300300">My name is Milibeth.</text>
<text id="72300310">The old women were once
Fire Keepers.</text>
<text id="72300320">I am here to look after them.</text>
<text id="72300330">It is what my mother did,
and her mother before her, and so on.</text>
<text id="72300400">The old women were keepers of the fire.</text>
<text id="72300410">But now,
the fire shows signs of fading...</text>
<text id="72300420">And the kingdom...is beset by Hollows...</text>
<text id="72300430">...</text>
<text id="72300500">The old women are sisters.
I am told there was a fourth.</text>
<text id="72300510">They have looked like that for as long as I have known them.</text>
<text id="72300520">Long ago, Fire Keepers were commonplace.</text>
<text id="72300530">But now they are lost, scattered to the winds.</text>
<text id="72305000">What are you doing!</text>
<text id="72305010">Leave at once!</text>
<text id="72305040">You brute!</text>
<text id="72305050">Stop this at once!</text>
<text id="72305060">What are you...!</text>
<text id="72306000">##Have a safe journey...</text>
<text id="72307000">You have proven yourself to the forest.</text>
<text id="72307010">We have little to offer, except perhaps these.</text>
<text id="72307020">May they bring fortune to your journey,
in some small way.</text>
