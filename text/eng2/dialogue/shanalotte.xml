<text id="70000000">Are you...the next monarch?</text>
<text id="70000010">Or...Merely a pawn of fate?</text>
<text id="70000020">Bearer of the curse...</text>
<text id="70000030">I will remain by your side.
Till this frail hope shatters...</text>
<text id="70000040">Take this with you.
May it ease your journey.</text>
<text id="70000050">Go on, and see the King.</text>
<text id="70000060">He who made Drangleic what it once was;
he who peered at the essence of the soul.</text>
<text id="70000070">King Vendrick.</text>
<text id="70000100">Bearer of the curse, seek misery.</text>
<text id="70000110">For misery will lead you to greater, stronger souls.</text>
<text id="70000120">You will never meet the King
with a soul so frail and pallid.</text>
<text id="70000130">##The curse is a part of life itself.
No one will ever be rid of it.</text>
<text id="70000140">##And so there is only one choice.
To await a worthy monarch.</text>
<text id="70000150">##A monarch who can shoulder your burden.</text>
<text id="70000160">##Lest this land swallow you whole...
As it has so many others.</text>
<text id="70000200">##Bearer of the curse...</text>
<text id="70000210">Seek those whose names are unutterable,
the four endowed with immense souls.</text>
<text id="70000220">Their souls will serve as beacons.</text>
<text id="70000230">Once you have found them,
return here to me.</text>
<text id="70000240">So that hope will not fade away.</text>
<text id="70000300">Bearer of the curse...</text>
<text id="70000310">Seek souls. Larger,
more powerful souls.</text>
<text id="70000320">Seek the King,
that is the only way.</text>
<text id="70000330">Lest this land swallow you whole...
As it has so many others. </text>
<text id="70000400">Bearer of the curse.
I will always be at your side.</text>
<text id="70000410">Until hope has fully withered...</text>
<text id="70000500">##Beyond the bonfire lies the Forest of the Giants,
where a great battle precipitated the kingdom's downfall.</text>
<text id="70000510">##The warriors who fell there still clutch their swords.</text>
<text id="70000520">##Perhaps something there will ease your journey.</text>
<text id="70000530">##You need not be afraid.
For the battle is done; the combatants, freed forever.</text>
<text id="70000600">##The far gate is the entrance to Heide's Tower of Flame.</text>
<text id="70000610">##Deep inside the tower is the cathedral,
which is today quite desolate.</text>
<text id="70000620">##The other path...
leads to a long-forbidden place.</text>
<text id="70000700">##Inside the giant pit...</text>
<text id="70000710">##Live the tiny beings that were once man's friends.</text>
<text id="70000720">##To face what is beyond the pit...
One must have both strength and courage.</text>
<text id="70000730">##Enough to deny death itself...</text>
<text id="70000800">Over the hill and past the forest is the King's castle.</text>
<text id="70000810">Where a man peered straight into the essence of the soul.</text>
<text id="70000820">But what ever came of it...</text>
<text id="70001000">Those who come to Drangleic seeking salvation
soon lose hope, and turn Hollow.</text>
<text id="70001010">It happens to them all,
sooner or later.</text>
<text id="70001030">That blue knight at the base of the tower...
His spirit is already broken.</text>
<text id="70001040">Although he does offer sound advice.</text>
<text id="70001050">Perhaps he is a foreshadowing of your own future?</text>
<text id="70001100">That tiny thing inside the ruins...</text>
<text id="70001110">An ancient being that will
mock your very existence.</text>
<text id="70001120">She imparts sound wisdom. </text>
<text id="70001130">Provided you find her on a good day...</text>
<text id="70001200">The sign you bear will
drain your very souls...</text>
<text id="70001210">And without souls, you will turn Hollow.</text>
<text id="70001220">Stay strong, do not lose hope.</text>
<text id="70001230">Even when you have precious little time.</text>
<text id="70001300">For when the Undead dies, it is never truly dead,
but only one step closer to Hollowing.</text>
<text id="70001310">Not all Undead are Hollows,
but all Hollows were once Undead.</text>
<text id="70001400">You have acquired
the soul of an Old One.</text>
<text id="70001410">That is more than most Undead can say.</text>
<text id="70001420">##Perhaps you will be the next to rule...</text>
<text id="70001500">The soul and the curse are one and the same.</text>
<text id="70001510">Your soul has grown stronger still.</text>
<text id="70001520">I only hope it brings you what you wish.</text>
<text id="70001530">##Bearer of the curse...
If you acquire all four souls,</text>
<text id="70001540">##then you will have proved yourself deserving.</text>
<text id="70001550">##Deserving of the king's throne in the castle.</text>
<text id="70001600">##The three old souls are now yours...</text>
<text id="70001610">Proceed,
bearer of the curse.</text>
<text id="70001620">It is the only choice left to you.</text>
<text id="70001700">You are blessed with a myriad of souls.</text>
<text id="70001710">Bearer of the curse,
make your way to the castle.</text>
<text id="70001720">##There, you will find the throne.
And your journey will end.</text>
<text id="70002000">Your soul is still frail and pallid...</text>
<text id="70002010">If you proceed regardless,
your fate will be more terrible than mere life or death.</text>
<text id="70002020">But I will not stop you,
if that is your heart's desire.</text>
<text id="70002210">This castle is isolated.</text>
<text id="70002220">But nonetheless,
you must forge on.</text>
<text id="70002240">To bring an end to your journey...and mine.</text>
<text id="70002250">End your journey...and mine.</text>
<text id="70002700">This ring is the symbol of the King.</text>
<text id="70002710">Use it to gain passage,
through the King's Gate...</text>
<text id="70002720">...and venture to the far east...</text>
<text id="70002730">##...and seek the home of the dragon, to the far east...</text>
<text id="70002740">Bearer of the curse,
if you are to be the next monarch,</text>
<text id="70002750">Then, one day, you will walk those grounds...</text>
<text id="70002760">...without really knowing why.</text>
<text id="70002800">Bearer of the curse.
Go to the east.</text>
<text id="70002810">To the place, beyond the King's Gate.</text>
<text id="70004200">Bearer of the curse.</text>
<text id="70004210">Long have I awaited one such as you,
one who might shatter the shackles of fate.</text>
<text id="70004220">One who can set me free.</text>
<text id="70004230">Bearer of the curse,
it was my own manifestation that led you here.</text>
<text id="70004240">The ancient dragon has watched over the world for aeons past.</text>
<text id="70004250">Take this.</text>
<text id="70004260">Do not resist.
The dragon welcomes you.</text>
<text id="70004270">##Now the throne lies within your grasp,
surely the dragon will speak to you.</text>
<text id="70004300">##Listen to what the dragon says.</text>
<text id="70004310">##With the throne so close at hand,
the dragon is sure to speak.</text>
<text id="70004400">My journey is already complete.</text>
<text id="70004410">My name is Shanalotte.</text>
<text id="70004420">The dragon gave me this name,
for I was born with none.</text>
<text id="70004430">I was born of dragons, contrived by men.</text>
<text id="70004440">By ones who would cozen fate herself...
They are the ones who created me.</text>
<text id="70004450">But they failed.</text>
<text id="70004460">I did not come out as intended.</text>
<text id="70004470">Fate would not be bested, and men were cursed once again.</text>
<text id="70004480">If you proceed, Nashandra will come after you.</text>
<text id="70004490">Knowing that you will take the throne, and link the fire.</text>
<text id="70004500">She covets the First Flame,
and the Great Soul.</text>
<text id="70004510">Put Nashandra to rest.</text>
<text id="70004520">##And then...</text>
<text id="70005030">What are you...?</text>
<text id="70005060">If that is your wish...</text>
<text id="70005070">##...</text>
<text id="70006000">##Bring an end to your journey...and mine.</text>
<text id="70008000">If you find an Estus Shard, bring it to me.</text>
<text id="70008010">So that I may ease your burden.</text>
<text id="70008100">Is that a shard you've found?</text>
<text id="70008110">Here, let me see it.
So that I may help you.</text>
<text id="70008120">To see light, to see hope...</text>
<text id="70008130">However faint it might be...</text>
<text id="70009999">...</text>
<text id="14600">You, who link the fire, you, who bear the curse...</text>
<text id="14610">Once the fire is linked, souls will flourish anew,
and all of this will play out again.</text>
<text id="14620">It is your choice...to embrace, or renounce this...</text>
<text id="14630">Great Sovereign,
take your throne.</text>
<text id="14640">What lies ahead, only you can see.</text>
