<text id="70400000">...Shush, you eejit, stay quiet!</text>
<text id="70400010">...I'm on the run, don't give me away!</text>
<text id="70400020">...You're a fugitive too, eh?</text>
<text id="70400030">...Yes, why else would you be here...</text>
<text id="70400040">...It's got death written all over it...</text>
<text id="70400100">...You want to climb down here?</text>
<text id="70400110">...I can lend you a ladder...</text>
<text id="70400120">...But em...ha...how much can you offer me?</text>
<text id="70400130">...Why, you! I'm trying to help you, you know...</text>
<text id="70400140">...Have you no gratitude? Downright rude, really!</text>
<text id="70400150">...But I've...I've...I've got a soft heart so...</text>
<text id="70400160">...I'll let you off, this once...</text>
<text id="70400200">...All right, it'll be just a moment...</text>
<text id="70400300">...Hell, of course it's not free!</text>
<text id="70400400">...Ahhh...Go on ahead, I won't offer this deal twice...</text>
<text id="70400500">...Oh, what is it? What do you need now?</text>
<text id="70400600">...No mate, these deals, they won't last forever...</text>
<text id="70400700">...Fine, then, all the best...</text>
<text id="70400800">...Oi! Downright rude, really...</text>
<text id="70400900">...Psst, have you heard?</text>
<text id="70400910">...You know why they're extracting that poison, do you?</text>
<text id="70400920">...Well, apparently there's this monster lady, right...</text>
<text id="70400930">...And the poison, well, does wonders for her body...</text>
<text id="70400940">...You know, health and beauty, and that sort of stuff...</text>
<text id="70400950">...And I thought only human women were so petty!</text>
<text id="70401000">...There's something I heard from the other prisoners...</text>
<text id="70401010">...That creature, she was human, once, you know...</text>
<text id="70401020">...Hmm, In fact, she was wed to the Prince of that nearby castle...</text>
<text id="70401030">...But her husband, hmm, he had feelings for another...</text>
<text id="70401040">...The Princess was desperate, and sought eternal beauty...</text>
<text id="70401050">...Hoping that it would restore the Prince's,
ah, affection, ha you see what I mean...</text>
<text id="70401100">...Before long, the Princess' ire transformed her into a monster...</text>
<text id="70401110">...Now listen here. When do you think this all happened?</text>
<text id="70401120">...Long ago, when this very land was called something else...</text>
<text id="70401130">...We say Drangleic now, but...</text>
<text id="70401140">...Countless kingdoms have risen and fallen on this very spot...</text>
<text id="70401150">...And this won't be the last...oh no...</text>
<text id="70401200">...That damned hag just can't
let her old flame go...</text>
<text id="70401210">...She's going to get us all burned...</text>
<text id="70401300">...Gods almighty...</text>
<text id="70401310">...I'm not going to die in this dump...</text>
<text id="70402000">What? Who are you?</text>
<text id="70402010">Er, the name's Gilligan.
Aye, don't make me say it twice!
Hah!</text>
<text id="70402020">All right, what do you want?</text>
<text id="70402030">I stock everything that
you could possibly need!
Hah hah hah!</text>
<text id="70402100">Wait, you found your way out, too! Hah!</text>
<text id="70402110">The name's Gilligan.
Don't make me say it twice!
Heh heh.</text>
<text id="70402120">All right, what do you want?</text>
<text id="70402130">I have everything
you need!
Heh heh heh...</text>
<text id="70402200">Ah! Back already? Ha.</text>
<text id="70402300">All right, what'd you forget this time? </text>
<text id="70402400">Hey, what've you been up to!</text>
<text id="70402500">Come to see auld Gilligan, have you? Hah!</text>
<text id="70402600">Cheers for that! Hah hah! </text>
<text id="70402700">What? Don't waste my time.</text>
<text id="70402800">Oi! Where're you off to now!</text>
<text id="70403000">Ohhh, I should've listened to the warnings.
This place is flippin' mental.</text>
<text id="70403010">Huh? No, I wasn't born here. I'm from a wee bit...
I'm from a wee bit out west, that's all.</text>
<text id="70403020">What? No, I wasn't born here.
I'm from Volgen.</text>
<text id="70403030">I've seen some rough times.
I think I'll settle down for a while.</text>
<text id="70403100">You wouldn't believe the shenanigans
that happen in my business.</text>
<text id="70403110">I thought at least here in the middle of nowhere
I could stay clear of, you know, my auld pals.</text>
<text id="70403120">Oh, don't ask me what happened!
Have you no discretion, me auld chum?</text>
<text id="70403200">That gaping hole? Hell, search me.</text>
<text id="70403210">It's where the people round here
toss all their rubbish.</text>
<text id="70403220">Corpses or you know what...Whatever they'd rather be rid of.</text>
<text id="70403230">Oh, and, and those human statues. Who are they supposed to be?</text>
<text id="70403240">Anybody, I suppose.
Probably just some auld pagan custom.</text>
<text id="70403250">What's it like at the bottom of the hole?
Why in the hell would I know! Hah!</text>
<text id="70403300">Oh, yes, somebody told me that the grave of a...
of a saint lies below here.</text>
<text id="70403310">Not built by the King, no no.
It dates back to a time long before him.</text>
<text id="70403320">The tomb connects to that hole.</text>
<text id="70403330">And there's...there's...
there's something about some...some Rat King down there.</text>
<text id="70403340">Hell,
if the old rat is as rich as they say,
maybe I should go and pay him a visit!</text>
<text id="70403400">You want to go down that awful hole?
 You must have lost your marbles!
Heh heh!</text>
<text id="70403410">Fine, sure, fine, I'm happy to be of service.</text>
<text id="70403420">You need a ladder, then, sure enough.</text>
<text id="70403430">But you'll...you'll have to show some generosity.</text>
<text id="70403500">Well! Fine, it's not my business, anyway.</text>
<text id="70403600">Hah! Yes, now we see eye to eye, don't we!</text>
<text id="70403610">Now, exactly how generous are we talking? Hmm?</text>
<text id="70404000">You just don't get it, do you.</text>
<text id="70404010">Fine, then, now it's my turn.</text>
<text id="70404100">A very reasonable offer!</text>
<text id="70404110">Just you wait! Hm-hm!</text>
<text id="70404200">Well! Really! A very generous offer indeed, especially from you!</text>
<text id="70404210">I get such a warm
feeling inside when I get
the chance to help others!</text>
<text id="70404300">Hmph! Fine, it's not my business, anyway.</text>
<text id="70404400">Hey, this ladder's not for sale!</text>
<text id="70404410">Th...the only things I sell are miniatures.
I mean, if that tickles yer fancy,
you can buy as many as you like!</text>
<text id="70404500">...What? You don't have a choice, do you!</text>
<text id="70404510">...Then, let's have it! Show me your finest...</text>
<text id="70404600">What, you're heading down after all?</text>
<text id="70404610">Well, that's fine, but if you want my help,
you'll need to make me an offer.</text>
<text id="70405000">You ungrateful little git!</text>
<text id="70405010">Why, you...I'll tear you limb from limb!</text>
<text id="70405020">It's your own damn fault.</text>
<text id="70405030">Hey! That hurts!</text>
<text id="70405040">How dare you!</text>
<text id="70405050">Aww, will you let off, y'eejit</text>
<text id="70405060">You vicious little! I'll not go down that easy!</text>
<text id="70406000">Ohhh, I've had enough of this place...</text>
<text id="70407000">Here you are my friend, you can have these, eh!
It's a little bonus, you know, for your big purchase.</text>
<text id="70407010">Ah come on, don't look so glum! I'm trying to be nice here!</text>
<text id="70407020">You're hopeless, I tell you...</text>
