<text id="50600000">Halt.</text>
<text id="50600010">Human.
Put that light out.</text>
<text id="50600020">Human.
Do not produce light.</text>
<text id="50600030">Light, and all those who bear it,
are unwelcome in this place.</text>
<text>#0After approaching his location for the 1st time with an ignited torch</text>
<text id="50600100">I warned you.</text>
<text id="50600110">You offend the dead.
And now, you will join them.</text>
<text>#0Talk-1st time</text>
<text id="50600200">I am Agdayne.
Guardian of the crypt.</text>
<text id="50600210">Countless dead rest here in peace.
Cradled by the comfort of dark.</text>
<text id="50600220">Light only agitates.
We have no need for it here.</text>
<text>#0Talk-2nd time</text>
<text id="50600300">I am a Fenito.
We weave death, and watch over the dead.</text>
<text id="50600310">This task was granted to me
by the one who gave us the first death.</text>
<text id="50600320">Countless souls rest here.
Some of them from ages long ago.</text>
<text id="50600330">Some were rich, others poor.
Some wise, some dull, but now, they are all just dead.</text>
<text>#0Talk-3rd time</text>
<text id="50600400">Did you come for him?
The one called Vendrick. </text>
<text id="50600410">You will find him deeper inside.</text>
<text id="50600430">Many castle servants and the like
have come to fetch their lord.</text>
<text id="50600440">But they rest here now,
put to death by the King's own guards.</text>
<text id="50600450">Perhaps he's not in the mood for company.</text>
<text>#0Talk-4th time</text>
<text id="50600500">In the past, humans were one with the dark.</text>
<text id="50600510">The former King of Light...
He feared humans.
Feared that they would usher in an age of dark.</text>
<text id="50600520">How queer, you humans.
How you go on, never separating truth from fiction.</text>
<text>#0Talk-5th time</text>
<text id="50600600">This place is welcome to all,
provided due reverence is shown.</text>
<text id="50600610">Death is equitable, accepting.
We will all, one day, be welcomed by her embrace.</text>
<text id="50600620">Tell me what you desire.
Show me reverence, and I will lend you my hand.</text>
<text>#0Talk-6th time</text>
<text id="50600700">What do you require, human?</text>
<text>#0Menu-Choose "Talk" after acquiring King's Ring</text>
<text id="50607000">You've met the King, have you?</text>
<text id="50607010">Life is never easy, never fair.
Even more so, on this path you've chosen.</text>
<text id="50607020">May you find your peace one day.</text>
<text id="50607030">Take these with you.
You may need them, as proof of your visit here.</text>
<text>#0Menu-Choose "Leave" without purchasing something</text>
<text id="50601000">Crude human, do as you please.</text>
<text>#0Menu-Choose "Leave" after purchasing something</text>
<text id="50600900">Farewell, human.</text>
<text>#0After leaving abruptly</text>
<text id="50600800">Going so soon?</text>
<text id="50600810">We will meet again, eventually.</text>
<text>#0Upon being attacked-1st time</text>
<text id="50605030">Hmph...</text>
<text>#0Upon being attacked-2nd time</text>
<text id="50605040">What are you doing.</text>
<text>#0Upon being attacked-3rd time</text>
<text id="50605050">Are you mad, human?</text>
<text>#0Upon being attacked &amp; made hostile</text>
<text id="50605000">Crude human, know your place!</text>
<text>#0Upon approaching him, after he has previously killed the protagonist</text>
<text id="50605010">The insolent will be punished.</text>
<text>#0Upon killing the protagonist</text>
<text id="50605020">Now, where shall we bury this one?</text>
<text>#0After reducing his health to 50% or lower</text>
<text id="50605060">The impunity...</text>
<text>#0Upon dying</text>
<text id="50605070">Hah hah... You fool.</text>
<text id="50601100">##...</text>

Farewell, human.</text>
