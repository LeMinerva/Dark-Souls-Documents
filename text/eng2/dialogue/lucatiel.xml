<text id="75200000">What is it?</text>
<text id="75200010">I don't know you, and you don't know me.</text>
<text id="75200020">Things are better that way.</text>
<text>#0Talk-2nd time</text>
<text id="75200100">Phew...</text>
<text id="75200110">Heh heh. You are an odd one.</text>
<text id="75200120">Normally, people keep a safe distance
when they see this mask. But you...</text>
<text id="75200130">I am called Lucatiel.</text>
<text id="75200140">From the land of Mirrah,
to the far east. across the mountains.</text>
<text id="75200200">They say Drangleic brims with powerful souls.</text>
<text id="75200210">And so I came to claim my share.</text>
<text id="75200220">But what a strange place...Even the rumours did not prepare me.</text>
<text>#0Talk-3rd time</text>
<text id="75200300">You are an odd one, indeed.
I've always made a point of avoiding people.</text>
<text id="75200310">While you've made a point of engaging me.</text>
<text id="75200320">I can see that you are mid-journey.
If you require assistance, I will help you.</text>
<text id="75200330">I come from Mirrah, a land of knights.
My sword is always ready.</text>
<text id="75200340">Don't hesitate to call upon me.
Whatever happens, I won't be missed...</text>
<text>#0Talk-1st time</text>
<text id="75200500">I thought that might be you.
You haven't changed a bit, have you? Heh heh.</text>
<text id="75200510">The longer I am here, the more madness I discover.</text>
<text id="75200520">A wretched place, indeed,
but not without traces of its former glory.</text>
<text id="75200530">What could have caused such degradation?</text>
<text>#0Talk-2nd time</text>
<text id="75200600">Ah, yes, I have not thanked you
for humouring me the other day.</text>
<text id="75200610">This is for you.</text>
<text id="75200620">Of course, I've no idea what it is.
Heh heh.</text>
<text>#0Talk-3rd time</text>
<text id="75200700">Our land of Mirrah is surrounded by enemies,
and constantly at war.</text>
<text id="75200710">There is only one way up in Mirrah.
Join the Order, and prove yourself in battle.</text>
<text id="75200720">My family had little fortune, and no name.
I had to carve out a piece of the world for myself...</text>
<text id="75200730">...with two things.
My sword, and my loyalty to my Lord.</text>
<text>#0Talk-4th time</text>
<text id="75200800">I was raised to wield a sword from birth.</text>
<text id="75200810">Life was hard,
but I never gave it a second thought.</text>
<text id="75200820">I had swift success on the battlefield,
and quickly attained respectable stature.</text>
<text id="75200830">And then I...</text>
<text id="75200840">And then I came here...to...</text>
<text>#0Talk-5th time</text>
<text id="75200900">Have you heard of the Undead?
These poor souls affected by the curse.</text>
<text id="75200910">An Undead gradually loses his humanity,
until his wits degrade completely.</text>
<text id="75200920">Finally, he turns Hollow, and preys upon others.</text>
<text id="75200930">And a Hollow can never be human again.</text>
<text id="75200940">One can skirt this wicked fate
only with the help of the souls found here.</text>
<text id="75200950">Assuming, of course, that the legends are true.</text>
<text id="75200960">I can only hope...that they are.</text>
<text>#0Talk-6th time</text>
<text id="75201000">I'm sorry...to burden you with talk of my fate.</text>
<text id="75201010">I suppose I've grown weary these days.</text>
<text>#0Talk-1st time</text>
<text id="75201100">Still on the road, are you?</text>
<text id="75201110">Sorry to have burdened you so.</text>
<text id="75201120">This is for you,
by way of an apology.</text>
<text>#0Talk-2nd time</text>
<text id="75201200">I've found my thoughts growing hazy.</text>
<text id="75201210">My memories are fading, oldest first.</text>
<text id="75201220">The curse is doing its work upon me.</text>
<text id="75201230">I am frightened... Terribly so...</text>
<text id="75201240">If everything should fade... What will be left of me...</text>
<text>#0Talk-3rd time</text>
<text id="75201300">I had an older brother.
We learned to fence together.</text>
<text id="75201310">He became the most decorated swordsman
in all of Mirrah.</text>
<text id="75201320">I never even compared to him.</text>
<text id="75201330">In fact, I never beat him, not once.</text>
<text id="75201340">But then, one day...
he was gone, lost without a trace.</text>
<text id="75201350">Now I'm certain. That he was taken, by the curse.</text>
<text>#0Talk-4th time</text>
<text id="75201400">If only someone would hear my tale...</text>
<text id="75201410">My brother must have come here, too.</text>
<text id="75201420">Soon, I may forget even about him...</text>
<text>#0Talk-1st time</text>
<text id="75201500">Oh... You...</text>
<text id="75201510">My thoughts...are very...
scattered...</text>
<text>#0Talk-2nd time</text>
<text id="75201600">What is this curse?</text>
<text id="75201610">The question rings in my mind,
but I haven't the focus to answer it.</text>
<text>#0Talk-3rd time</text>
<text id="75201700">Loss frightens me no end.
Loss of memory, loss of self.</text>
<text id="75201710">If I were told that by killing you,
I would be freed of this curse...</text>
<text id="75201720">Then I would draw my sword without hesitation.</text>
<text id="75201730">I don't want to die,
I want to exist.</text>
<text id="75201740">I would sacrifice anything, anything at all for this.</text>
<text id="75201750">It shames me, but it is the truth.</text>
<text>#0Talk-4th time</text>
<text id="75201800">Sometimes, I feel obsessed...
with this insignificant thing called "self".</text>
<text id="75201810">But even so, I am compelled to preserve it.</text>
<text id="75201820">Am I wrong to feel so? Surely you'd do the same, in my shoes?</text>
<text id="75201830">...</text>
<text id="75201840">Maybe we're all cursed...</text>
<text id="75201850">From the moment we're born...</text>
<text>#0Talk-1st time</text>
<text id="75201900">Who are you...</text>
<text id="75201910">Oh...No, forgive me...
I know you... Yes, of course.</text>
<text>#0Talk-2nd time</text>
<text id="75202000">How goes your journey?</text>
<text id="75202010">I know not what you seek
in this far-away land...</text>
<text id="75202020">But I pray for your safety.</text>
<text>#0Talk-3rd time</text>
<text id="75202100">My name is Lucatiel.</text>
<text id="75202110">I beg of you, remember my name.</text>
<text id="75202120">For I may not myself...</text>
<text>#0Talk-Summoning her as White Phantom &amp; defeating 3 bosses without dying</text>
<text id="75207000">Please take these.</text>
<text id="75207010">Consider this thanks,
for keeping me sane...</text>
