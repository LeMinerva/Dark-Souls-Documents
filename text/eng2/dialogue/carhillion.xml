<text id="76600000">Hmm...I sense power...</text>
<text id="76600010">Very well. From this day, you shall be my new pupil.</text>
<text id="76600020">I am Carhillion. Carhillion of the Fold.
Surely you've heard the name?</text>
<text id="76600030">Now, now, do not be afraid.
Let us explore the limits of sorcery.</text>
<text id="76600100">Hmm...</text>
<text id="76600110">I see light, but it remains dim...</text>
<text id="76600120">I am Carhillion, and I've no interest in the magic-impaired.</text>
<text id="76601000">Do you seek my teachings?
Very well, very well.</text>
<text id="76601100">Back already?
Your diligence is commendable.</text>
<text id="76601200">Your visit is welcome.
I trust you've kept up your studies.</text>
<text id="76601300">Oh, there you are.
Do you seek my teachings?</text>
<text id="76601400">Young pupil, do not take my teachings lightly.</text>
<text id="76601500">One day, my teachings will save you.</text>
<text id="76601600">Young pupil, may we meet again, in Majula.</text>
<text id="76601700">The path is yet long, young pupil.</text>
<text id="76602000">The forces of magic, and souls, lie dormant in this land.</text>
<text id="76602010">It is a fitting place to hone my sorceries.</text>
<text id="76602020">I suspect that I may even conjure up new spells here.</text>
<text id="76602030">Sorcery is yet a mystery, even to me.
Let us mature together, young pupil.</text>
<text id="76602100">Use scrolls to unleash the power of sorceries.</text>
<text id="76602110">But the power of each scroll
is reliant on that of its owner.</text>
<text id="76602120">The untrained cannot wield a scroll to its proper potential.</text>
<text id="76602130">Never forget, young pupil...
There are no shortcuts to mastery.</text>
<text id="76603000">Oh, so you've finally decided to join us?</text>
<text id="76603010">Let us resume our exploration of sorcery.</text>
<text id="76603100">Sorcery and pyromancy thrive in Melfia.
I've spent much time there, trying to perfect my art.</text>
<text id="76603110">But staying was a mistake.
The fools there
had no interest in truth.</text>
<text id="76603120">Their ambitions were paltry, and their smiles cloying.
I was sick to the back teeth of their petty squabbles.</text>
<text id="76603130">There was nothing for me in that forsaken land.</text>
<text id="76603200">On my trip here,
I met a strange girl once or twice.</text>
<text id="76603210">After a time, I never saw her again.
I wonder where she went off to.</text>
<text id="76603220">We spoke only a few times, but...
A fair lass, if a bit clumsy.</text>
<text id="76603230">I hope that she is safe.</text>
<text id="76603400">I sense a dark power here.</text>
<text id="76603410">Something akin to sorcery...
Only more...primordial...</text>
<text id="76603420">I wish to find out more about it, but as we see, this place is in ruins.</text>
<text id="76603430">Just what happened here?</text>
<text id="76603500">Sorcery was created long, long ago.</text>
<text id="76603510">Some say it was originated by the great pale being...</text>
<text id="76603520">But we've no way of knowing if such claims are true.</text>
<text id="76603530">Many sorceries were lost over the ages.</text>
<text id="76603540">Before pyromancy, there were fire sorceries,
but they are long forgotten.</text>
<text id="76603600">So, the girl's been here too.</text>
<text id="76603610">I'm glad to see her safe, whatever that's worth.</text>
<text id="76605000">The arrogance of the young!</text>
<text id="76605010">Behold my true power.</text>
<text id="76605020">How very tragic...</text>
<text id="76605030">Stop that!</text>
<text id="76605040">Have you lost your head?</text>
<text id="76605050">Damn, you bloody fool!</text>
<text id="76606000">##Do not neglect your studies, dear pupil.</text>
<text id="76607000">Ah, here, a fitting gift for you.</text>
<text id="76607010">Seek higher planes,
young pupil.</text>
