<text id="77100000">P-please, just stay away.</text>
<text id="77100010">No, please, don't come near me.
Nothing good will come of it.</text>
<text id="77100100">Just leave me alone, please.</text>
<text id="77100110">Leave this place, and leave me be,
as I'd not see any harm befall you.</text>
<text id="77100200">Please,
just leave me alone.</text>
<text id="77100300">I haven't said anything strange, have I?</text>
<text id="77100310">I have absolutely no intention of leaving here.</text>
<text id="77100320">Do not attempt to help me.
Just let me sit here, and wither quietly away...</text>
<text id="77100400">Well, you're nicely hollowed, aren't you...</text>
<text id="77100410">Undead, eh?
Well, you've come a long way.</text>
<text id="77100420">Are you tormented by memories? Burdened by guilt?</text>
<text id="77100430">Now the question. Are you ready for more?
If you are, then we ought to talk...</text>
<text id="77100500">This? This contains my power.</text>
<text id="77100510">Long ago...this...naïve vessel of mine
set about devising new spells.</text>
<text id="77100520">The fool dreamt of bringing new forms
of magic into the world.</text>
<text id="77100530">But instead, he created me.
Mostly by chance, but he did a fine job, I must say.</text>
<text id="77100540">What he sought was strength.
And so, I decided to demonstrate.</text>
<text id="77100550">While my vessel slept, I'd find my mark, and hunt him down.</text>
<text id="77100560">But my vessel did not approve.
And so while I slept, he sealed the both of us away.</text>
<text id="77100800">Now, I don't have anything against humans,
but how is it that you go about defining good and evil?</text>
<text id="77100810">I'm only using what the Gods gave me.
How can that be so wrong?</text>
<text id="77100830">So, what say you to a spot of murder on my behalf?</text>
<text id="77100840">If you don't, I'll leave this place,
and take more lives.
Many more.</text>
<text id="77100850">I couldn't give a fig either way.
So, what's your choice?</text>
<text id="77100900">Yes, I see,
how very kind of you.</text>
<text id="77100910">I want you to kill a merchant named Gilligan.
A greedy, foul man. He won't be missed, I assure you.</text>
<text id="77100920">Hmm...yes... Bring me a Ladder Miniature as proof.</text>
<text id="77100930">He's the only person who'd have such an odd knick-knack...
Heh heh...</text>
<text id="77101000">I want you to kill a merchant named Gilligan.</text>
<text id="77101010">And don't forget that Ladder Miniature.
Heh heh...</text>
<text id="77101100">Yes, yes, of course.
Forget that I asked.</text>
<text id="77101110">That's what "good people" do, am I right?</text>
<text id="77101120">Your feeble mind can't begin to comprehend me.
Not that you've ever tried!
Heh heh...</text>
<text id="77101200">Heh heh heh... Fine work.</text>
<text id="77101210">This is my thanks. Take it.</text>
<text id="77101220">Now, let's discuss our next mark.</text>
<text id="77101230">Now, let's discuss something of importance.</text>
<text id="77101300">I want you to kill one more.</text>
<text id="77101310">Your target will be Cale,
the man who's drafting that map.</text>
<text id="77101320">While I was trapped in here, he touched me,
that maniac, like I was some rare specimen.</text>
<text id="77101330">He wore a strange helm.
Bring it back as proof.</text>
<text id="77101400">Yes,
I knew I could count on you.</text>
<text id="77101410">Perhaps this will slake my thirst. </text>
<text id="77101500">I want you to kill Cale,
the cartographer.</text>
<text id="77101510">Bring his helm as proof.</text>
<text id="77101600">I want you to kill one more.</text>
<text id="77101610">You target is Felkin, the hexer.</text>
<text id="77101620">As proof, bring me that peculiar sceptre of his.</text>
<text id="77101630">As proof, bring me a hex of his creation.</text>
<text id="77101640">What do you say?</text>
<text id="77101700">Yes, very good.</text>
<text id="77101710">But he will be formidable.
Be cautious.</text>
<text id="77101800">I want you to kill Felkin.
That's Felkin, the hexer.</text>
<text id="77101810">He has that sceptre.
Bring it to me as proof.</text>
<text id="77101820">Bring me a hex
of his creation as proof.</text>
<text id="77102000">You could kill a dozen like that, and it wouldn't matter.
I want you to kill someone of import.</text>
<text id="77102010">I want you to kill the girl
in Majula known as the Muse.</text>
<text id="77102020">They say that she is the last Fire Keeper.
But they say a lot of things...</text>
<text id="77102030">That she's a gentle shepherd,
lighting the way for you cursed fools.
Nonsense.</text>
<text id="77102040">I want you to kill the strange girl in Majula.</text>
<text id="77102050">Once she is dead, I will have no regrets,
and I will be content to remain here.</text>
<text id="77102060">The girl will have a peculiar feather.
Bring it to me.</text>
<text id="77102070">Now, go along.
Heh heh...</text>
<text id="77102100">Having second thoughts?</text>
<text id="77102110">It's your choice.</text>
<text id="77102120">Ah hah hah, now you're getting nervous, hmm?</text>
<text id="77102200">Your mark is the girl in Majula known as the muse.</text>
<text id="77102210">Your mark is that strange girl in Majula.</text>
<text id="77102220">And don't forget that feather.
Heh heh heh...</text>
<text id="77102300">Yes, that's the feather.</text>
<text id="77102310">Good, oh that is very good!</text>
<text id="77102320">Your reward, take it.
Heh heh heh...</text>
<text id="77102400">Now I am at peace.</text>
<text id="77102410">I will sit here, and watch the world turn. Heh heh...</text>
<text id="77102500">What do you require?</text>
<text id="77102510">You've been good to me. Go on, tell me what you need.</text>
<text id="77102600">Find what you wanted? Hah hah hah hah...</text>
<text id="77102700">Well, as you wish. Heh heh...</text>
<text id="77102800">Oh, no?</text>
<text id="77102900">Hmgh...</text>
<text id="77102910">I hope you appreciate the ramifications.</text>
<text id="77102920">Well, no matter. What's done is done.</text>
<text id="77102930">Besides, I've found myself a new mark... Gah hah hah...</text>
<text id="77103000">I'll spend some time travelling the lands...</text>
<text id="77103010">Slowly tracking my new mark...</text>
<text id="77103100">By the very gods... What have you done...</text>
<text id="77103110">You've really done it... You'll never escape him...</text>
<text id="77105000">You are most intriguing.
Heh heh...</text>
<text id="77105010">Let's get right to it, shall we?</text>
<text id="77105020">Hmm, ooh... Hah hah hah hah! Not bad at all.</text>
<text id="77105030">Hmm...</text>
<text id="77105040">Yes, I see.</text>
<text id="77105050">Do you jest?</text>
<text id="77105060">Heh heh heh, ah hah hah hah!</text>
<text id="77105070">Death...aargh...could be worse...</text>
<text id="77105100">Please, stop that!</text>
<text id="77105110">What are you doing?!</text>
<text id="77105120">Eeg!</text>
<text id="77106000">Heh heh heh heh heh...</text>
<text id="77107000">These are for you.</text>
<text id="77107010">Don't mind the specks of blood...
Heh heh heh
