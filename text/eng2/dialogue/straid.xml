<text id="76800000">Still a bit stiff,
I'm afraid. Heh heh heh...</text>
<text id="76800010">I must thank you, young traveller.</text>
<text id="76800020">I am Straid.
A wandering sorcerer of sorts.</text>
<text id="76800030">I've been a guest for a very long time.
But I don't think that
anybody will miss me!</text>
<text id="76800100">##I sense the curse within you.</text>
<text id="76800110">##It has made you terribly frail.</text>
<text id="76800120">##Your faith and intelligence are anaemic.
Life must be unbearable.
Heh heh...</text>
<text id="76800200">Cursed one, you lack intelligence.</text>
<text id="76800210">Weak, so terribly weak...</text>
<text id="76800220">Heh heh heh...</text>
<text id="76800300">##Cursed one, you lack faith.</text>
<text id="76800310">##You are weak, very weak...</text>
<text id="76800320">##Heh heh heh
...</text>
<text id="76800400">Hm-hmm...</text>
<text id="76800410">Very good, very good indeed.</text>
<text id="76800420">Cursed one, weak you may be,
but I, Straid, will teach you my spells.</text>
<text id="76800500">Souls! I need souls! You cursed fool!</text>
<text id="76800510">If you seek my strength, bring me souls!</text>
<text id="76800520">Bigger, stronger souls!
Heh heh...</text>
<text id="76800600">Feeble cursed one!</text>
<text id="76800610">Do you really think you can manage
the glories that are my spells?</text>
<text id="76800700">Feeble cursed one!</text>
<text id="76800710">Let's hope the magnificence
of my spells does not deter you!
Heh heh!</text>
<text id="76800800">Well! This is a most peculiar soul.</text>
<text id="76800810">Very good, very good indeed.</text>
<text id="76800820">Unusual souls produce unusual spells.
Heh heh heh...</text>
<text id="76800900">Well! This is a most charming soul.</text>
<text id="76800910">Very good, very good indeed.</text>
<text id="76800920">My power is yours! Let it serve your desires! Heh heh heh...</text>
<text id="76801000">Well! This is a most twisted soul.</text>
<text id="76801010">Very good, very good indeed.</text>
<text id="76801020">Prepare to peer straight into the heart of magic.
Heh heh heh...</text>
<text id="76801100">So, how long was I sat petrified...</text>
<text id="76801110">Long enough for the old kingdom to have crumbled, I see.</text>
<text id="76801120">##Long enough for Olaphis to rise, fall, and fade away, evidently.</text>
<text id="76801130">Why didn't anyone wake me sooner?!
Heh heh...</text>
<text id="76801200">Drangleic... I've never heard the name.</text>
<text id="76801210">Is that what they call this place now?</text>
<text id="76801220">Very good. Hah hah...
Very good indeed.</text>
<text id="76801300">The cursed ones were imprisoned within this land.</text>
<text id="76801310">Of course, you came of your own free will.
Heh heh...</text>
<text id="76801320">The people feared the cursed ones like a plague.</text>
<text id="76801330">##Our king, Alvis, feared the cursed ones like the plague.</text>
<text id="76801340">Some people would rather keep
dreadful things out of sight, out of mind.</text>
<text id="76801350">In the end they swept them up
and corralled them here.</text>
<text id="76801360">So very typical of meek minds, don't you think?</text>
<text id="76801400">Once people became aware of their own frailty...</text>
<text id="76801410">They seized anybody they found undesirable,
cursed or no, and impounded them here.</text>
<text id="76801420">Whoever posed even the slightest threat, was removed.
All so that they could sleep better at night.</text>
<text id="76801430">They even turned the great Straid into a stone! Hah hah!</text>
<text id="76801500">Many kingdoms rose and fell on this tract of earth;
mine was by no means the first.</text>
<text id="76801510">Anything that has a beginning also has an end.
No flame, however brilliant,
does not one day splutter and fade.</text>
<text id="76801520">But then, from the ashes, the flame reignites,
and a new kingdom is born, sporting a new face.</text>
<text id="76801530">It is all a curse! Heh heh heh!</text>
<text id="76801540">And it is your cursed flesh that will inherit the flame.
Heh heh...</text>
<text id="76801600">Pyromancy was created by the ancient witch of fire.</text>
<text id="76801610">She harnessed the power of flame, and melded it into pyromancy.</text>
<text id="76801620">The witch led her daughters into war against the Old Ones.</text>
<text id="76801630">But
legends are legends.</text>
<text id="76801640">What are you prepared to believe? Heh heh...</text>
<text id="76802000">Don't just walk off, cursed one.
Heh heh...</text>
<text id="76805000">Weak, so terribly weak...</text>
<text id="76805010">Come back for more, little cursed one?
Heh heh...</text>
<text id="76805020">Hah hah hah hah!</text>
<text id="76805030">Heh heh heh...</text>
<text id="76805040">How testy, little cursed one!</text>
<text id="76805050">You dare challenge me? Heh heh...</text>
<text id="76805060">Ooh, you're tough, cursed one! Heh heh...</text>
<text id="76805070">Very good, very good indeed.</text>
<text id="76806000">Weak, so terribly weak...</text>
<text id="76807000">Cursed one, take these.</text>
<text id="76807010">Put them on, and please, stop being so weak.
Heh heh...</text>
