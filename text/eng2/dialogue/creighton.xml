<text id="74200000">Who are you?</text>
<text id="74200010">I thought you were that bastard for a moment.</text>
<text id="74200020">You've set me free. Now I can find him.</text>
<text id="74200030">The cheeky prick. He won't know what hit him.</text>
<text id="74200100">I am Creighton, of Mirrah.
I travel from land to land to hone my blade.</text>
<text id="74200110">I've heard this land was full of danger.
I thought it would suit me perfectly. </text>
<text id="74200120">I joined forces with a man on the way,
but he was no more than a back-stabbing knave.</text>
<text id="74200130">He took the first chance he had to try and off me.</text>
<text id="74200140">I decided to set a trap for him here, but then I got trapped myself.</text>
<text id="74200150">I can't believe that I was so dense.
Thank the stars that you came along.</text>
<text id="74200200">You be careful of him. Pate, I think he said.</text>
<text id="74200210">He wears this rather unusual ring.
You know it when you see it.</text>
<text id="74200220">I've seen his type before. He kills entirely for the pleasure of it.</text>
<text id="74200230">I'm sure I won't be his last victim.
The man's better off dead, I tell you.</text>
<text id="74200240">He's a slick talker, so don't let him fool you.</text>
<text id="74200300">Pate, the man with the strange ring.
Watch out for the slimy rat.</text>
<text id="74200310">And don't you believe a word he says.</text>
<text id="74200320">I'll find the common footpad, and put an end to his roguery.
Heh heh.</text>
<text id="74200400">Heh heh... Just wait, you dirty rat...</text>
<text id="74200500">Hm? Oh...oh! I-I remember you?!</text>
<text id="74200510">Don't you scare me like that. I thought you were him.</text>
<text id="74200600">That bastard with the ring lives in Brightstone Cove down the way.</text>
<text id="74200610">I'm gonna find him and settle the score.
Nobody insults me like that.</text>
<text id="74200700">For the good of the world, and for my own honour.</text>
<text id="74200710">I won't let that bastard live another day.
Heh heh...</text>
<text id="74201000">Damn! You're tougher than you look!</text>
<text id="74201100">...Serves you right...Hah hah hah!</text>
<text id="74201110">...Hah hah...Hah hah hah hah!</text>
<text id="74201200">...I did it...Hah hah!</text>
<text id="74201210">Thanks for your help. He was no pushover...</text>
<text id="74201220">Here, take this,
and go to my bolt-hole down the way.</text>
<text id="74201230">What's there is yours.</text>
<text id="74201240">Just a small token of appreciation.</text>
<text id="74201300">You did me well.</text>
<text id="74201400">...Serves you right...Hah hah hah!</text>
<text id="74201500">...Wait... ...You weren't friends with that rat, were you?</text>
<text id="74201510">Then jog on... You've no business with me.</text>
<text id="74201600">Oh, you. What do you want?</text>
<text id="74201610">That bastard's run off somewhere.</text>
<text id="74201700">Your ring! That's his ring!</text>
<text id="74201710">You're not friends with the bastard, are you?</text>
<text id="74201720">Hand that ring over to me.
He's no friend of yours. You can do without it.</text>
<text id="74201730">Think carefully before you answer.</text>
<text id="74201800">You killed him, didn't you?</text>
<text id="74201810">Fair play.
As long as he got what he deserved.</text>
<text id="74201820">Here, take this,
and go to my bolt-hole down the way.</text>
<text id="74201830">What's there is yours.</text>
<text id="74201840">Just a small token of appreciation.</text>
<text id="74201900">You did me well.</text>
<text id="74202000">I see how it is. You're another slimy toad!</text>
<text id="74202100">Ooh, that'll leave a nasty scar!</text>
<text id="74205000">Do you want some? Fine enough!</text>
<text id="74205010">Don't you ever give up!</text>
<text id="74205020">Next time, you think before you pick a fight! </text>
<text id="74205030">Whoah!</text>
<text id="74205040">Hey, watch it there!</text>
<text id="74205050">Why, you!</text>
<text id="74205060">Damn! This isn't right!</text>
<text id="74205070">Aiiieegh!</text>
<text id="74206000">##Heh... Rotten bastard...</text>
<text id="74207000">Here, these are for you.</text>
<text id="74207010">You did me well.
Just take 'em.</text>
