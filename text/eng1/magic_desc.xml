As difficult to use as Heavy Soul Arrow,
but powerful enough to make it well worth it.
Adored by certain sorcerers.</text>
<text id="3040">Sorcery developed by Big Hat Logan.
Fire homing soulmass.

window into seeker Logan's methods.</text>
<text id="3050">Sorcery boosted by the knowledge

Fire homing crystal soulmass.

The mysteries of souls, crystals, and the
sorceries are deeply intertwined.</text>

is referenced repeatedly in the legends, and
is said to be on par with Lord Gwyn's lightning.</text>

These pale magic spears, sharpened
through crystallization, are on par with
the armaments of the ancient lords.</text>

<text id="3400">Ancient sorcery of the lost land of Oolacile.
Turns right weapon invisible.

Not a simple augmentation, making it
dependent on the skill of its caster. 
An example of the capacity of Oolacile
sorceries to control light.</text>
<text id="3410">Ancient sorcery of the lost land of Oolacile.
Turns body nearly invisible.

Although perfect invisibility is unachievable
due to the risk of dissipation, the caster
need only stand still for a moment to blend
in to environs with astounding camouflage.</text>
<text id="3500">Ancient sorcery of the lost land of Oolacile.
Cast a bright light upon surroundings.

This light-producing sorcery is elementary
but nonetheless demonstrates the achievements
in mysticism of Oolacile. Such magic has
not been developed even in Vinheim.</text>
<text id="3510">Sorcery developed by a certain surreptitious
sorcerer at Vinheim Dragon School.
Masks all noises of caster.

Effectively, Vinheim is controlled by the
Dragon School, and it is no wonder that the
town has its share of dark secrets.</text>

sound originating in the distance.

extremely effective.</text>
<text id="3530">Ancient sorcery of the lost land of Oolacile.

<text id="3600">Sorcery of the red-robed remedician

of curses is no easy task indeed.</text>

one of the Sealers of New Londo.
Reduce bleeding and poison build-up,
and undo various poisonous effects.

take her healing arts back to Blighttown.</text>
<text id="3700">Sorcery developed by Logan during his
infatuation with Seath the Scaleless.

<text id="3710">Abyss sorcery discovered by an Oolacile
sorcerer on the brink of madness.

sorcerer on the brink of madness.

physical damage. Perhaps a human soul is
closer to matter in its humanity.</text>
<text id="3730">Abyss sorcery discovered by an Oolacile
sorcerer on the brink of madness.
Create a cloud of Dark Fog.

Although Dark Fog is, in theory, relatively
close to humanity, it also happens to be a
terrible poison for humans. Perhaps it
reflects man's cruelty against his own.</text>
<text id="3740">Sorcery of Manus, Father of the Abyss.
Grant a fleeting will to the Dark of
humanity, and volley the result.

The will feels envy, or perhaps love,
and despite the inevitably trite and
tragic ending, the will sees no alternative,
and is driven madly toward its target.</text>

For this very reason, the flame thus
created is fierce.</text>

considered a heretic even at the Great Swamp.

serves a deformed young girl who speaks
an unintelligible tongue.</text>
<text id="4210">Unique pyromancy crafted by Eingyi,

One only need cast this pyromancy, a perverse
diversion from the art of fire, to find out.</text>
<text id="4220">Pyromancy foreign to the Great Swamp.
Emit acid which corrodes weapons and armor.

Not all pyromancy originates in the Great
Swamp. One hears rumors of unknown

as the caster becomes exceedingly heavy
and unable to move freely.</text>
<text id="4310">Pyromancy of Carmina, who harnessed the power
of flame to actualize the inner-self.

Carmina, the most accomplished pupil of
Salaman the Master Pyromancer, pioneered
new directions for the art of pyromancy.</text>
<text id="4360">Advanced pyromancy of Quelana of Izalith.
Charm Undead and gain temporary allies.

relationship is part and parcel to the art of
pyromancy. Can be used by either gender.</text>
<text id="4400">Pyromancy of Carmina, who harnessed the power
of flame to actualize the inner-self.
Short strength/endurance boost, but lose HP.

the Dark of the Abyss by a pyromancer
who wandered into Oolacile.

physical damage, enough to smack away
the mightiest of shields.</text>

<text id="5210">Great miracle cast by advanced clerics.
Return to last bonfire rested at.

only the curse of the Undead has distorted
its power, redirecting casters to a bonfire.
Or perhaps for Undead, this serves as home?</text>
<text id="5300">Common miracle amongst cleric knights.
