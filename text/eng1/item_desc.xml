<text id="1110">Dragon scale for reinforcing dragon weapons.
Peeled from an ancient dragon.

A dragon is inseparable from its scales,
and the transcendent apostles, who seek
the perpetuity of the ancient dragons,
have crossed the very end of the earth
to seek this invaluable treasure.</text>
<text id="1120">Special titanite stolen from a faceless
stone beast known as a Titanite Demon.

When the nameless blacksmith deity passed,
from several Slabs, great beasts arose.
The power of titanite remains within them,
and they still roam Lordran today.</text>
<text id="1130">This weapon-reinforcing titanite is imbued
with a particularly powerful energy.
Reinforces weapons that cannot be
reinforced normally to +5.

After this titanite was peeled from its Slab,
it is said that it received a special power,
but its specific nature is not clear.</text>
<text id="2001">Opens the narrow passage leading below
at the far face of the great bridge in
the Undead Burg.

The lower Undead Burg is a treacherous place.
Do not turn your back on the wily thieves, or
the wild dogs who serve the Capra Demon.</text>
<text id="2002">This crest opens a door in the
Darkroot Garden sealed by ancient magic.

The door leads to the grave of Sir Artorias
the Abysswalker. Many adventurers have left
for the grave, but none have returned,
for they make easy prey for local bandits.
With such dangers, the crest can do more harm
than good in the hands of the uninitiated.</text>
<text id="2003">Key to the hanging cage in Sen's Fortress.

If a hapless adventurer becomes fatigued
during an imprudent attempt to overcome the
fortress, the serpent men will not kill him,
but lock him up in a lonely cage.
Eventually, unless they have forgotten,
they drag the victim off to who-knows-where.</text>
<text id="2004">Key to the cell of the Duke's Archive Tower.

The Archive Tower, once a trove of precious
tomes and letters, became a prison after the
onset of Seath's madness. The serpent men
who guard the prison know not the value of
what they hide. In the basement of the tower
are the writhing "mistakes" of the terrifying
experiments which were conducted there.</text>
<text id="2005">Key to the giant door leading out from
the uppermost floor of Archive Tower,
which now serves as a prison.

The key's design resembles not the key of a
prison; indeed, the tower was once no prison
at all, but a trove of precious tomes.</text>
<text id="2006">Key to the giant cell below the Duke's
Archive Tower.

The giant cell once imprisoned countless
maidens, but is now empty, save for a few
key persons. They struggle to uphold their
sanity, as the horde of "mistakes" writhe
at a fearfully close proximity.</text>
<text id="2007">Key to Blighttown from the Depths of the
Undead Burg. Swallowed by the Gaping Dragon.

As its name suggests, Blighttown is a place
of great pestilence. Even the polluted
inhabitants of the Depths are aware of its
dangers, and built this mighty door in hopes
that they could remain safely separated.</text>
<text id="2008">Key to the iron bars separating the ruins of
New Londo and Drake Valley.

The ruins of New Londo were blocked off,
for the cursed ghosts posed danger to life
and spirit, and the legends speak of a
terrible Dark which was sealed away.</text>
<text id="2009">Key to the annex in the Painted World
of Ariamis.

In the wintery painted world, there is
a structure resembling an old cathedral;
its annex serves as a type of storehouse.</text>
<text id="2010">Key to the dungeon of the Undead Asylum to
the North.

A mysterious knight, without saying a word,
shoved a corpse down into the cell, and on
its person was this key. Who was this knight?
And what was his purpose? There may be no
answers, but one must still forge ahead.</text>
<text id="2011">Key to the inner door of the Undead Asylum
main hall. Big key belonging to a chosen
Undead pilgrim.

But this Chosen Undead knows not what
this pilgrimage has in store.</text>
<text id="2012">Key to the iron bars on the east side of the
second floor of the North Undead Asylum.

The Undead Asylum is a giant Undead prison,
segmented by countless iron bars.

Even if an Undead were to escape from a
cell, passage to the outside world would
not be gained easily.</text>
<text id="2013">Key to the floodgates of New Londo, which
seal away the Four Kings who fell to Dark.

The Sealers flooded New Londo to banish
the Darkwraiths and the Four Kings.
The agonizing decision was made with the
realization that countless lives, and the
robust culture of the city, would be lost.
The victims now roam the ruins as ghosts.</text>
<text id="2014">Key opening the door from the lower
Undead Burg to the Depths.

Those banished from the Undead Burg eke out
their existence in the Depths, a damp lair
with no trace of sunlight. Nearly half of
the Depths form a perilous flooded labyrinth.</text>
<text id="2015">Key opening the lift leading to New Londo
ruins in the basement of Firelink Shrine.

The ruins of New Londo were blocked off,
for the cursed ghosts posed danger to life
and spirit, and the legends speak of a
terrible Dark which was sealed away.</text>
<text id="2016">Key to the iron bars on the west side of the
second floor of the North Undead Asylum.

The Undead Asylum is a giant Undead prison,
segmented by countless iron bars.

But even if a hero found a key in Lordran
to liberate this prison, would he have the
means, or the heart, to ever come back?</text>
<text id="2017">The purpose of this key is unknown.
It appears to be a basic prison cell key.</text>
<text id="2018">Key to the sewer chamber in the Depths.

In any community, a few bad apples are sure
to exhibit insatiable greed. If they were
turned Undead, and banished to the Depths,
would they reconsider their ways?

Use this key to see for yourself.</text>
<text id="2019">Key to the basement of the watchtower in
the Undead Burg.

The basement of the watchtower forms a stone
cell. There are rumors of a hero turned
Hollow who was locked away by a dear friend.
For his own good, of course.</text>
<text id="2020">Extra key to a cell in the
Duke's Archive Tower.

Perhaps the serpent men were careless,
for there are several keys scattered
about which fit Archive Tower cells.</text>
<text id="2021">Key to a residence in the Undead Burg.
Simple, sturdy design of the locks in
the Burg keep out unwanted visitors.

But this is a standard key in these parts,
and will open several residences.</text>
<text id="2022">Bent Crest Key.

The grooves of the crest are enchanted,
the door sealed with a powerful spell.</text>
<text id="2100">This universal key opens any basic lock.
Tool of the trade for thieves.

But in the cursed land of the Undead,
most doors are better left unopened.</text>
<text id="2500">Soul of Gravelord Nito, first of the dead.
This Lord Soul was discovered at the
dawn of the Age of Fire.

Gravelord Nito administers the death of all
manner of beings. The power of this soul is
so great that it satiates the Lordvessel,
despite the fact that much of its energy has
already been offered to death.</text>
<text id="2501">Soul of the Bed of Chaos and the mother
of all demons. This Lord Soul was found
at the dawn of the Age of Fire.

The Witch of Izalith attempted to duplicate
the First Flame from a soul, but instead
created a distorted being of chaos and fire.
Its power formed a bed of life which would
become the source of all demons, and is more
than enough to satiate the Lordvessel.</text>
<text id="2502">Soul of one of the Four Kings, who fell to
Dark. A fragment of a Lord Soul discovered
at the dawn of the Age of Fire.

Lord Gwyn recognized the foresight of these
four great leaders of New Londo, and granted
them their ranks and the fragments of a
great soul. Although this is not a full Lord
Soul, it can still satiate the Lordvessel.</text>
<text id="2503">Soul of the albino Seath the Scaleless.
A fragment of a Lord Soul discovered
at the dawn of the Age of Fire.

Seath allied with Lord Gwyn and turned upon
the dragons, and for this he was awarded
Dukedom, embraced by the royalty, and given
a fragment of a great soul. Although just a
piece, it will still satiate the Lordvessel.</text>
<text id="2510">Lordvessel bestowed upon the chosen Undead
who is destined to succeed Lord Gwyn.
The chosen Undead is granted the art of
warping between bonfires.

To open the final door, place this vessel
on the Firelink Altar, and fill it with
powerful souls.</text>
<text id="2520">Half of a broken stone pendant.
The vine appears to originate from Oolacile.

A powerful magic can be sensed from this
ancient stone. Yet men of this time can
neither manipulate nor sense its power,
which has a distinct air consisting of
both reverence and nostalgia.</text>
<text id="2600">Tool used to etch titanite
into weapons for reinforcement.

Rest at a bonfire to make
weapon reinforcement possible.</text>
<text id="2601">Tool used to etch titanite
into armor for reinforcement.

<text id="2602">Specialized mortar used to repair weapons
and armor by grinding repair powder.

and armor repair possible.
Repair powder is fragile,
and cannot be taken along.</text>
<text id="2607">This secret rite allows bonfires to be
bolstered further with Kindling, so that
even more Estus can be collected.

Kindling was a sacred rite passed down
among clerics, but all Undead can imitate
the process, in the same manner that they
restore their Hollowing with humanity.
How peculiar that humans had found little
use for humanity until they turned Undead.</text>
<text id="2608">A peculiar bottomless wooden box.
Its origins are unknown. Some deride
it as a symbol of unbridled avarice.

Any number of items can be deposited into
the box, and items can be managed while
resting at a bonfire.</text>
