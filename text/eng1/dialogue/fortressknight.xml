<text id="35000101">Ah, what? What? Who are you?</text>
<text id="35000102">Ahh, another Undead, eh? I took on Sen's Fortress alone...</text>
<text id="35000103">But I'm no different from those vile creatures...
I was driven by conceit...</text>
<text id="35000104">Ahh, you think you're different? That you can handle it?</text>
<text id="35000105">Yes, I remember that feeling. For I was the same.</text>
<text id="35000106">...So, let me help you out. With your soul-searching.</text>
<text id="35000200">...</text>
<text id="35000201">Hm...Oh, yes, it's you.</text>
<text id="35000202">What is it? Still something you need, eh, anything at all?</text>
<text id="35000203">##What is it?</text>
<text id="35000220">...</text>
<text id="35000221">Hm, ah, oh you?</text>
<text id="35000222">Still alive? That's a surprise.</text>
<text id="35000223">Anything you want? What's mine is yours, but at a price!</text>
<text id="35000300">Nothing at all?</text>
<text id="35000301">Fine then, rush in like a naked babe, and be skinned alive!</text>
<text id="35000320">So, you're that good? Don't need a thing?</text>
<text id="35000321">Bah. It won't be long, before you're begging for mercy.</text>
<text id="35000400">Go along, try and make something of yourself.</text>
<text id="35000401">But nothing will come of it. And I should know!</text>
<text id="35000420">There you go, another brave soul.</text>
<text id="35000421">But soon you shall see...You and I are no different...</text>
<text id="35000422">Yes, yes, you soon shall see...</text>
<text id="35000423">...the putrid fate we both share...</text>
<text id="35000500">...Hmm?</text>
<text id="35000600">...Hm, fine, fine. I understand.</text>
<text id="35000601">I have my head about me.</text>
<text id="35000700">Hrgro!</text>
<text id="35000720">Hrgrah!</text>
<text id="35000740">Hrgroah!</text>

<text id="35000900">Hrrggahh...</text>
<text id="35000901">Ahhh...help me...</text>
<text id="35001000">There's nothing more to say.</text>
<text id="35001001">I'm finished. We're both on the brink, you see?</text>
<text id="35001002">End of story. You bloody fool.</text>
<text id="35001100">Let me give you a nibble of advice.</text>
<text id="35001101">Don't even consider visiting Anor Londo. Not in your state.</text>
<text id="35001102">For a century, they have tried, and failed.</text>
<text id="35001103">The Knight King Rendal, Black Iron Tarkus,
and even Logan himself.</text>
<text id="35001104">You won't stand a chance. You'll be eaten alive.</text>
<text id="35001105">But, go along, if you wish.
If only to deepen your despair!</text>
<text id="35001200">Where do I get all my things?</text>
<text id="35001201">Stripped off the corpses
of fools like yourself.</text>
<text id="35001202">It isn't easy.
I have to catch them just before they go Hollow.</text>
<text id="35001203">Don't worry. I'll be there to claim your trinkets.
Gazing at your final twisted grimace!</text>
<text id="35001204">Gee hee hee hee hee!</text>
