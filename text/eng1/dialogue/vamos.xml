<text>#0After falling through the hole leading into Vamos' chamber</text>
<text id="30000000">...Be gone with you!</text>
<text id="30000001">...You'll spoil my focus.</text>
<text>#0Talk</text>
<text id="30000100">...What's that, then? Need some smithing?</text>
<text id="30000101">Then produce me some wares!</text>
<text>#0Menu-Choose "Talk" 1st time</text>
<text id="30001700">...Hmph! I'm here to smith, not to chit chat.</text>
<text>#0Menu-Choose "Talk" 2nd time</text>
<text id="30001800">...I've told you, I'm here for the trade, not for the talk!</text>
<text>#0Menu-Choose "Talk" 3rd time</text>
<text id="30001900">Enough with your presence. It disturbs me.</text>
<text>#0Menu-Choose "Talk" 4th time</text>
<text id="30002000">Well, you are a persistent one, are you not? </text>
<text id="30002001">But I'm afraid I'm a mere blacksmith, it's just me and my trade.</text>
<text id="30002002">I would be of no help to a righteous warrior such as yourself.</text>
<text>#0Menu-Choose "Talk" 5th time, after defeating the Gaping Dragon</text>
<text id="30002100">I've told you, I have nothing to discuss...</text>
<text id="30002101">If I have anything to offer, it's my smithing, and nothing more.</text>
<text id="30002102">I'd be of more help with that ember from New Londo,
of course...</text>
<text id="30002103">It's a shame the whole place was flooded...</text>
<text>#0Menu-Choose "Talk" 6th time after defeating Chaos Witch Quelaag</text>
<text id="30002200">I've told you, I have nothing to discuss...</text>
<text id="30002201">If I have anything to offer, it's my smithing, and nothing more.</text>
<text id="30002202">Speaking honestly, I must say that I'm at my very limit.
There's no more work to be done.</text>
<text id="30002203">Ahh, unless I had the flame of that legendary witch...</text>
<text id="30002204">But that would require a visit to Lost Izalith. Impossible...</text>
<text>#0Talk-After finding the Large Flame Ember</text>
<text id="30001000">...Hmph? Why, is that...</text>
<text id="30001001">...An ember from New Londo...</text>
<text id="30001002">...And a fine ember it be...</text>
<text id="30001003">What do you say? Why not leave it with me?</text>
<text id="30001004">I'll give you a flame to feast your eyes upon.</text>
<text>#0Choose "No" to giving the Large Flame Ember</text>
<text id="30001100">Hmm, hmm, yes, yes, I see...</text>
<text id="30001101">Well, do not hesitate if you should change your mind...</text>
<text>#0Choose "Yes" to giving the Large Flame Ember</text>
<text id="30001200">Yes, yes, very well! We'll get these old bones to work!</text>
<text id="30001201">Keh heh heh!</text>
<text>#0Talk-After finding the Chaos Flame Ember</text>
<text id="30001300">...Hmph? Why, that's...</text>
<text id="30001301">...an ember unlike any that I have seen...</text>
<text id="30001302">...a very curious pattern...</text>
<text id="30001303">...Could it be the flame of the legendary witch?</text>
<text id="30001304">...I know! Suppose you left that ember with me?</text>
<text id="30001305">Old Vamos would never let you down, no, not ever!</text>
<text>#0Choose "No" to giving the Chaos Flame Ember</text>
<text id="30001400">Hmm, hmm...Fine, then...</text>
<text id="30001401">I doubt you'd even...bah, forget it...</text>
<text id="30001402">These bones won't fail me anytime soon.
I'll come across another, eventually...</text>
<text>#0Choose "Yes" to giving the Chaos Flame Ember</text>
<text id="30001500">Keh heh heh heh heh!</text>
<text id="30001501">Yes, splendid, splendid indeed!</text>
<text id="30001502">...My, oh, my! You precious little thing...</text>
<text>#0Talk-After finding an ember Vamos cannot use</text>
<text id="30001600">...Hmph? Why, you have...</text>
<text id="30001601">...an ember, do you?</text>
<text id="30001602">Ahh, forget about it. I don't deal with that kind.</text>
<text id="30001603">What has gone wrong with embers these days?</text>
<text>#0Menu-Choose "Leave" without purchasing something</text>
<text id="30000300">Well, what was that about?</text>
<text id="30000301">Don't be coming around here without a good reason!</text>
<text>#0Menu-Choose "Leave" after purchasing something</text>
<text id="30000400">If that'll be all, then be gone with you!</text>
<text id="30000401">...You'll spoil my focus.</text>
<text>#0After leaving abruptly</text>
<text id="30000500">Now where've you gone?</text>
<text>#0Talk-After leaving abruptly</text>
<text id="30000600">...You've got rotten manners.</text>
<text id="30000601">If it be smithing you need, then produce your wares.</text>
<text>#0Upon being attacked-1st time</text>
<text id="30000700">Bah!</text>
<text>#0Upon being attacked-2nd time</text>
<text id="30000750">You rotten scoundrel!</text>
<text>#0Upon being attacked &amp; made hostile</text>
<text id="30000800">Trying to cause trouble, are you?</text>
<text id="30000801">I am Vamos the blacksmith, and I'm no bag of bones!</text>
