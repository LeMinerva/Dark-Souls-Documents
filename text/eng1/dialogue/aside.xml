<text>#0Prologue</text>
<text id="100">In the Age of Ancients,</text>
<text id="101">the world was unformed, shrouded by fog.</text>
<text id="102">A land of grey crags, archtrees, and everlasting dragons.</text>
<text id="120">But then there was Fire.</text>
<text id="121">And with Fire, came Disparity.</text>
<text id="122">Heat and cold,</text>
<text id="123">life and death,</text>
<text id="124">and of course... Light and Dark.</text>
<text id="140">Then, from the Dark, They came,</text>
<text id="141">and found the Souls of Lords within the flame.</text>
<text id="160">Nito, the first of the dead,</text>
<text id="161">the Witch of Izalith, and her Daughters of Chaos,</text>
<text id="162">Gwyn, the Lord of Sunlight, and his faithful knights,</text>
<text id="163">and the furtive pygmy, so easily forgotten.</text>
<text id="180">With the Strength of Lords, they challenged the dragons.</text>
<text id="200">Gwyn's mighty bolts peeled apart their stone scales.</text>
<text id="201">The witches weaved great firestorms.</text>
<text id="202">Nito unleashed a miasma of death and disease.</text>
<text id="220">And Seath the Scaleless betrayed his own,</text>
<text id="221">and the dragons were no more.</text>
<text id="222">Thus began the Age of Fire.</text>
<text id="300">But soon, the flames will fade, and only Dark will remain.</text>
<text id="320">Even now, there are only embers,</text>
<text id="321">and man sees not light, but only endless nights.</text>
<text id="322">And amongst the living are seen, carriers of the accursed Darksign.</text>
<text>#0Northern Undead Asylum</text>
<text id="1000">Yes, indeed. The Darksign brands the Undead.</text>
<text id="1001">And in this land,</text>
<text id="1002">the Undead are corralled and led to the north,</text>
<text id="1003">where they are locked away, to await the end of the world.</text>
<text id="1004">...This is your fate.</text>
<text>#0Leaving Undead Asylum</text>
<text id="2000">Only, in the ancient legends it is stated,</text>
<text id="2001">that one day an Undead shall be chosen</text>
<text id="2002">to leave the Undead Asylum, in pilgrimage,</text>
<text id="2003">to the land of the Ancient Lords,</text>
<text id="2004">Lordran.</text>
