<text>#0Talk-1st time after defeating the Amber Crystal Golem imprisoning her</text>
<text id="39000000">It was you who rescued me? Why, thank you.</text>
<text id="39000001">I am Sieglinde of Catarina.</text>
<text id="39000002">I don't know how I ended up in that crystal...</text>
<text id="39000003">It wasn't terrible in there, but I could hardly move.</text>
<text id="39000004">I must think of some way to repay you.</text>
<text>#0Talk-2nd time after defeating the Amber Crystal Golem imprisoning her</text>
<text id="39000100">Oh! Have you seen my father?</text>
<text id="39000101">You wouldn't miss him. A suit of armour, just like mine?</text>
<text>#0Choose "No" to the query</text>
<text id="39000140">Yes, I see...But if you should happen to bump into him,</text>
<text id="39000141">tell him that Sieglinde is on her way,
and that he ought to just stay put.</text>
<text id="39000142">And again, thank you kindly.</text>
<text>#0Choose "Yes" to the query</text>
<text id="39000120">Thank goodness! I knew he was here somewhere.</text>
<text id="39000121">Well then, now I must find him.
Thanks again, truly.</text>
<text id="39000122">Now if he'll just stay put,
and keep out of trouble.</text>
<text>#0Talk-1st time</text>
<text id="39020000">Oh, hello again.</text>
<text id="39020001">We're both managing quite well, aren't we?</text>
<text id="39020002">But I haven't found my father yet.
Have you seen him?</text>
<text>#0Choose "No" to the query</text>
<text id="39020005">Yes, I see. Well, I had to ask.</text>
<text id="39020006">I will continue searching a bit longer. Thank you so much.</text>
<text>#0Choose "Yes" to the query</text>
<text id="39020003">Really! Then I must be off.</text>
<text id="39020004">I'm sorry he's caused you trouble...
He has a knack for that. If he'd just stay put...</text>
<text>#0Talk-1st time after helping Siegmeyer defeat &amp; survive the 4 Chaos Eaters</text>
<text id="39020100">Well, hello again!</text>
<text id="39020101">I have finally located my father.</text>
<text id="39020102">All of your help was invaluable to us...
Thank you so much.</text>
<text id="39020103">I was finally able to pass on my mother's last words.</text>
<text>#0Talk-2nd time after helping Siegmeyer defeat &amp; survive the 4 Chaos Eaters</text>
<text id="39020200">My father? He went on his final adventure.</text>
<text id="39020201">Don't worry, that's just the way he is.
Undead or no. Sort of reassuring, really.</text>
<text id="39020202">If he goes Hollow,
I'll just have to kill him again.</text>
<text>#0Talk-1st time</text>
<text id="39030000">My father...all Hollow now...
has been subdued. He will cause no more trouble.</text>
<text id="39030001">It's finally over...I will return to Catarina.</text>
<text id="39030002">You assisted us both greatly.
I can hardly return the favour,</text>
<text id="39030003">but please accept this. It's of no use to me now.</text>
<text>#0Talk-2nd time</text>
<text id="39030100">Oh, father...dear father...</text>
<text id="39030101">Sob...</text>
<text>#0Upon being attacked-1st time</text>
<text id="39000230">What in the...!</text>
<text>#0Upon being attacked-2nd time</text>
<text id="39000240">What the devil?!</text>
<text>#0Upon being attacked &amp; made hostile</text>
<text id="39000300">Yes, now I see.</text>
<text id="39000301">You are one of the bad ones.</text>
<text id="39000302">Then, there's only one thing to do with you.</text>
<text>#0Upon killing the protagonist</text>
<text id="39000500">Rest assured. I will kill you as many times as it takes.</text>
<text>#0Upon dying</text>
<text id="39000400">Oh, how can this be...!</text>
<text id="39000401">...dear Father...</text>
