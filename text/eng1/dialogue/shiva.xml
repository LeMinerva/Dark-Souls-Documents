<text>#0Talk-1st time after joining the Forest Hunter Covenant</text>
<text id="41000000">I've heard all about you.</text>
<text id="41000001">I'm Shiva of the East, captain of the brigade.</text>
<text id="41000002">Let's teach you the clan basics now,</text>
<text id="41000003">as there is no time to chat in the midst of fighting.</text>
<text id="41000004">Except there's little in the form of rules, you hear?</text>
<text id="41000005">Fight and hunt as you like. Whoever's fastest gets the prey.
That's the way we do it.</text>
<text id="41000006">Only...Don't forget what Alvina said.
Traitors aren't given a second chance, for any reason.</text>
<text id="41000007">That's about it, then.</text>
<text id="41000008">Don't worry, it's a good old time, isn't it?</text>
<text id="41000009">Great to have you with us. Good hunting to you.</text>
<text>#0Talk-2nd time</text>
<text id="41000200">Don't worry, now.</text>
<text id="41000201">You'll be called in soon enough.</text>
<text id="41000202">Hunters with patience score the best kills.</text>
<text>#0Talk-After speaking to his Shinobi bodyguard</text>
<text id="41000100">Ah, did you notice that one? Sharp eyes!</text>
<text id="41000101">He's one of the clan. From the East, like myself.</text>
<text id="41000102">Always slinking in the shadows, but he's a tough one.</text>
<text id="41000103">You'll see what I mean.</text>
<text id="41000104">Hah hah hah hah!</text>
<text>#0Talk-1st time</text>
<text id="41010000">Hello again.</text>
<text id="41010001">Strange to meet away from the clan and the forest.</text>
<text id="41010002">But while you're here, how about some equipment?</text>
<text id="41010003">I love collecting these things, but I can only keep so many.</text>
<text id="41010004">And, you know, you are a friend. I'll sell them cheap.</text>
<text>#0Talk-2nd time</text>
<text id="41010100">We meet again.</text>
<text id="41010101">I have the equipment, if you have the need.</text>
<text>#0Talk-3rd time</text>
<text id="41010200">Well, there you are again.</text>
<text id="41010201">I've culled my best picks from my last summoning.</text>
