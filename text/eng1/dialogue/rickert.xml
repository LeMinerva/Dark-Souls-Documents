<text>#0Talk-1st time</text>
<text id="32000000">Hrm?</text>
<text id="32000001">Well, this is unusual. You haven't lost your head.</text>
<text id="32000002">And more importantly, you're free. How on earth...</text>
<text id="32000003">...Well, I shouldn't pry.</text>
<text id="32000004">I am Rickert of Vinheim.</text>
<text id="32000005">I was once an established smith, but look at me now.</text>
<text id="32000006">Can you believe it?</text>
<text>#0Talk-2nd time</text>
<text id="32000020">Hm? What is it?</text>
<text id="32000021">Have you...Oh, no, don't worry. I've no intention of escape.</text>
<text id="32000022">It's safe here. I can't bear the thought of going Hollow out there.</text>
<text id="32000023">Although, I must admit, I've not much to occupy myself.</text>
<text id="32000024">How about this? 
I could forge your weapons, albeit with rather minimal tools.</text>
<text id="32000025">I will show you what made me the best in Vinheim!</text>
<text>#0Talk-3rd time</text>
<text id="32000100">Oh, hello.</text>
<text id="32000101">What weapons have you brought? Go on; show me.</text>
<text>#0Talk-4th time</text>
<text id="32000150">Oh, hello.</text>
<text id="32000151">I was beginning to wonder when you'd come.</text>
<text id="32000152">Have you materials? Go on, show me.</text>
<text>#0Talk-5th time</text>
<text id="32000030">Hm? What is it?</text>
<text id="32000031">Normally I wouldn't bother, but...</text>
<text id="32000032">I must admit, I've not much to occupy myself.</text>
<text id="32000033">How about this? 
I could forge your weapons, albeit with rather minimal tools.</text>
<text id="32000034">I will show you what made me the best in Vinheim!</text>
<text>#0Menu-Choose "Talk"</text>
<text id="32001600">Hm? What is it?</text>
<text id="32001601">There's nothing to talk about.</text>
<text id="32001602">We're both cursed; Undead.
But what's there, really, to moan about?</text>
<text>#0Menu-Choose "Talk" 1st time after freeing Griggs of Vinheim</text>
<text id="32001700">Old Big Hat? Of course I've heard of him.</text>
<text id="32001701">Who hasn't in Vinheim?</text>
<text id="32001702">He was a royal member of Dragon School,
until he turned Undead.</text>
<text id="32001703">I hear he was quite the character...
Only, that was a hundred years ago.</text>
<text id="32001704">What interest have you in the old eccentric now?</text>
<text>#0Menu-Choose "Talk" 2nd time after freeing Griggs of Vinheim</text>
<text id="32001800">Sorcery? Don't ask me how it actually works.</text>
<text id="32001801">We only fiddle and forge, until it works itself in.</text>
<text id="32001802">That's how we do it in Vinheim, at least.</text>
<text id="32001803">We prefer to leave the theorizing to those uppity scholars.</text>
<text>#0Talk-After obtaining the Large Magic Ember</text>
<text id="32000900">Hey, hang on...</text>
<text id="32000901">That's a sorcery ember...isn't it?</text>
<text id="32000902">Yes, it certainly is...
The first I've seen since my banishment from Vinheim.</text>
<text id="32000903">What do you say, friend? Mind giving that to me?</text>
<text id="32000904">This is no-man's land.
I'm the only one who could handle it anyway.</text>
<text>#0Choose "No" to giving the Large Magic Ember</text>
<text id="32001000">...Yes, I see. All right, fine.</text>
<text id="32001001">But I don't think you're really seeing things clearly.</text>
<text>#0Choose "Yes" to giving the Large Magic Ember</text>
<text id="32001100">Yes, as you should!</text>
<text id="32001101">I won't disappoint you. I'm taskless no longer!</text>
<text>#0Talk-After obtaining the Enchanted Ember</text>
<text id="32001200">Hey, hang on...</text>
<text id="32001201">Is that...a sorcery ember?</text>
<text id="32001202">I've never seen one like that, not even back in Vinheim.</text>
<text id="32001203">What a brilliant flame!</text>
<text id="32001204">Please, friend, let me have that. I am begging you.</text>
<text id="32001205">I am a craftsman of Vinheim.
I'd go Hollow before I pass up a flame like that!</text>
<text>#0Choose "No" to giving the Enchanted Ember</text>
<text id="32001300">...Fine.</text>
<text id="32001301">...Fine, I won't bother you.</text>
<text id="32001302">It was wonderful if only to gaze upon.</text>
<text id="32001303">It takes me back to old times.</text>
<text>#0Choose "Yes" to giving the Enchanted Ember</text>
<text id="32001400">Oh, really! You are wonderful!</text>
<text id="32001401">I will forge a Rickert masterpiece, just for you!</text>
<text id="32001402">A weapon to make a legend out of you...</text>
<text>#0Talk-While holding an ember he cannot handle</text>
<text id="32001500">Hey, hang on...</text>
<text id="32001501">Is that an ember?</text>
<text id="32001502">Oh, no, I'm sorry.
We of Vinheim don't deal in shoddy embers like that.</text>
<text id="32001503">Perhaps you should try an old smith out in the country.</text>
<text>#0After leaving abruptly</text>
<text id="32000400">Hm? What's happened?</text>
<text>#0Talk-After leaving abruptly</text>
<text id="32000500">What was that about?</text>
<text id="32000501">Ahh, it doesn't matter.</text>
<text>#0Choose "Leave" without forging or reinforcement</text>
<text id="32000200">Come back soon.</text>
<text id="32000201">Smithing helps soothe my nerves.</text>
<text id="32000202">Don't let me wither away out of idleness!</text>
<text>#0Choose "Leave" after forging or reinforcement</text>
<text id="32000300">Good-bye, then.</text>
<text id="32000301">Keep your head on, out there.</text>
<text id="32000302">You really help break the monotony.</text>
<text>#0Upon being attacked</text>
<text id="32000660">What's got into you!</text>
<text>#0Upon being attacked &amp; made hostile</text>
<text id="32000700">Damn, you've gone Hollow, have you?</text>
<text id="32000701">Forget about it! I have nothing more to say.</text>
<text id="32000702">Be gone!</text>
<text id="32000703">Oh, go away!</text>
<text id="32000704">There's nothing here for you. Nothing at all.</text>
<text>#0Upon dying</text>
<text id="32000800">No...impossible...</text>
<text id="32000801">Why didn't I see?</text>
<text id="32000802">...You've gone Hollow...</text>
