<text id="11000003">If you seek Lord Gwyn's old keep,</text>
<text id="11000004">exit here and head straight yonder.</text>
<text id="11000005">If you are the chosen one, a revelation shall visit thee.</text>
<text id="11000006">...What follows thereafter, depends upon you...</text>
<text>#0Talk-2nd time</text>
<text id="11000100">Hmm. You have survived. Impressive.</text>

<text id="11000102">That is, after all, what the bonfire is for.</text>
<text>#0Talk-1rd time after leaving &amp; returning to Anor Londo</text>
<text id="11000300">Hmm. You have made it back. Very well.</text>

<text id="11000303">Even an Undead requires repose.</text>
<text>#0Talk-2rd time after leaving &amp; returning to Anor Londo</text>
<text id="11000301">Hmm. You have made it back. You were gone so long.</text>
<text id="11000302">Go ahead, you may rest here.</text>
<text id="11000303">Even an Undead requires repose.</text>

<text id="11000400">Hm, what is it?</text>
<text id="11000401">What am I? Well...I am the Keeper of the bonfire.</text>
<text id="11000402">If not for me, what beacon would there be in this lost city?</text>
<text id="11000403">A gatekeeper, and a guide;
that is my calling.</text>
<text>#0Menu-Choose "Talk" 2nd time</text>
<text id="11001400">The bonfires attended by the Keepers are special.</text>
<text id="11001401">They are linked to one another, and their flames never die.</text>
<text id="11001402">Yet never shall the Keepers of these flames meet.</text>
<text>#0Talk-1st time after receiving the Lordvessel</text>

<text>#0Talk-2nd time after receiving the Lordvessel</text>
<text id="11001300">Have you heard of Seath the Scaleless?</text>
<text id="11001301">In legend, he turned against the ancient dragons.</text>
<text id="11001302">He became Lord Gwyn's confidant,
was granted dukedom, and was allowed to pursue his research.</text>
<text id="11001303">At the Regal Archives, he immersed himself in research on
scales of immortality, the one thing that he did not have.</text>
<text id="11001304">...But his very research drove him mad... </text>
<text id="11001305">The Archives became a dungeon, a place for sinister experiments.</text>
<text id="11001306">Now, nobody dares even approach the duke's forbidden Archives.</text>
<text id="11001307">It looms over this land, high atop the mountain.</text>
<text id="11001308">But I should warn against even an approach...</text>

<text id="11001103">For we exist only with your blessing.</text>
<text>#0Talk-After joining the "Blade of Darkmoon" Covenant</text>
<text id="11001200">Oh...You are one of us.</text>
<text id="11001201">That is a surprise. But a pleasant one.</text>
<text id="11001202">We are both Blades of the Darkmoon, now.</text>
<text id="11001203">I shall look forward to fighting alongside you.</text>
<text>#0Upon being attacked-1st time</text>

<text>#0Meeting in hostile state after killing the illusion of Gwynevere</text>
<text id="11000900">So...It was you, was it?</text>
<text id="11000901">How dare you produce a blade upon a deity?
How did you ever get this far?</text>
<text id="11000902">I shall end your suffering here and now. It is the least that I can do.</text>
<text>#0Upon killing the protagonist</text>
<text id="11000800">Tis a pity...To think I saw potential in you...</text>
