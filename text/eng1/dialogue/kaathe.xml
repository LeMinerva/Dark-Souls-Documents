<text>#0Talk-1st time after defeating the Four Kings, after obtaining Lordvessel</text>
<text id="44000000">Greetings, Undead warrior.</text>
<text id="44000001">I am the primordial serpent Darkstalker Kaathe.</text>
<text id="44000002">I can guide thee, and illuminate the truth.</text>
<text id="44000003">Undead Warrior, conqueror of the Four Kings;
is this not your wish?</text>
<text id="44000004">To know the truth of men, and the Undead?</text>
<text>#0Choose "No" to either the 1st or 2nd query</text>
<text id="44000400">...</text>
<text id="44000401">...Very well.</text>
<text id="44000402">Warriors as yourself are few. I will be patient.</text>
<text id="44000403">But I cannot wait forever...</text>
<text>#0Talk-After choosing "No" to either the 1st or 2nd query</text>
<text id="44000700">What is it?</text>
<text id="44000701">Perhaps you have changed your mind?</text>
<text>#0Choose "Yes" to either the 1st or 2nd query</text>
<text id="44000100">A wise choice, Undead warrior.</text>
<text id="44000101">Prove you must,
that the truth becomes you.</text>
<text id="44000102">Seek Anor Londo.</text>
<text id="44000103">And claim Gwyn's heirloom, the Lordvessel.</text>
<text id="44000107">Now go, Undead warrior.</text>
<text id="44000108">Show the world that the truth becomes you.</text>
<text>#0Talk-2nd time</text>
<text id="44000500">Ahh...</text>
<text id="44000501">If you wish, I shall grant the art of Lifedrain,</text>
<text id="44000502">the legendary power of the Dark Lord.</text>
<text id="44000503">It can preserve your humanity while Undead,</text>
<text id="44000504">and cast off the shackles placed upon your brethren.</text>
<text>#0Talk-3rd time</text>
<text id="44000600">What is it?</text>
<text id="44000601">I am your guardian.</text>
<text id="44000602">Go on, state your wish.</text>
<text>#0Menu-Choose "Talk" before obtaining the Lordvessel</text>
<text id="44001800">Undead warrior,</text>
<text id="44001801">To speak now is premature.</text>
<text id="44001802">It begins with your retrieval of the Lordvessel.</text>
<text>#0Talk-After obtaining the Lordvessel</text>
<text id="44000900">Hmm...You are astonishing.</text>
<text id="44000901">The truth I shall share, without sentiment.</text>
<text id="44000902">After the advent of Fire, the ancient Lords found the three souls. </text>
<text id="44000903">But your progenitor found a fourth, unique soul.</text>
<text id="44000904">The Dark Soul.</text>
<text id="44000905">Your ancestor claimed the Dark Soul,
and waited for Fire to subside.</text>
<text id="44000906">And soon, the flames did fade, and only Dark remained.</text>
<text id="44000907">Thus began the age of men, the Age of Dark.</text>
<text id="44000908">However...</text>
<text id="44000909">Lord Gwyn trembled at the Dark.</text>
<text id="44000910">Clinging to his Age of Fire, and in dire fear of humans,</text>
<text id="44000911">and the Dark Lord who would one day be born amongst them,</text>
<text id="44000912">Lord Gwyn resisted the course of nature.</text>
<text id="44000913">By sacrificing himself to link the Fire,
and commanding his children to shepherd the humans,</text>
<text id="44000914">Gwyn has blurred your past,
to prevent the birth of the Dark Lord.</text>
<text id="44000915">I am the primordial serpent.</text>
<text id="44000916">I seek to right the wrongs of the past, to discover our true Lord.</text>
<text id="44000917">But the other serpent, Frampt, lost his sense,
and befriended Lord Gwyn.</text>
<text id="44000918">Undead Warrior, we stand at a crossroads.</text>
<text id="44000919">Only I know the truth about your fate.</text>
<text id="44000920">You must destroy the fading Lord Gwyn,
who has coddled Fire and resisted nature,</text>
<text id="44000921">and become the Fourth Lord,
so that you may usher in an Age of Dark!</text>

<text id="44001300">Nonsense!</text>
<text id="44001301">Are you mad! This is deplorable!</text>
<text id="44001302">You would rather be a slave? Does the truth mean nothing to you?</text>
<text id="44001303">This is unacceptable! Impossible! Unthinkable!</text>
<text id="44001304">...</text>
<text id="44001305">...Oh, enough with you.</text>

<text id="44001202">Seek Gravelord Nito, the Witch of Izalith,
and the traitor Seath the Scaleless.</text>
<text id="44001203">Fill this vessel with their souls.</text>
<text id="44001204">Then, the gate will open...so that you may kill Gwyn.</text>
