<text id="58000000">Hm? A visitor, have we?</text>
<text id="58000010">Thou must be the one who freed Artorias.</text>
<text id="58000020">An old friend he was,
and thanks to thee...</text>
<text id="58000030">He left this world with honour intact.</text>
<text id="58000040">...And here I am, retired and blind.</text>
<text id="58000050">Of little help to thee, I am afraid.</text>
<text id="58000100">Well, thou hast come again. This is a surprise.</text>
<text id="58000200">Well, thou com'st again. Thou art a strange one.</text>
<text id="58000300">Good morrow...Is the Black Dragon posing thee duress?</text>
<text id="58000400">Yes, I thought as much.</text>
<text id="58000410">He is called Kalameet.</text>
<text id="58000420">A ferocious dragon indeed,
even mighty Anor Londo dared not provoke his ire.</text>
<text id="58000430">I see little good coming from this, but...</text>
<text id="58000440">...Thy intent is to persevere... to the bitter end, hmm?</text>
<text id="58000500">Hah hah hah!</text>
<text id="58000510">Good, good. What is bravery, without a dash of recklessness!</text>
<text id="58000520">I have taken a liking to thee.</text>
<text id="58000530">And I owe thee much for thy service to Artorias.
Now watch, and see how Gough hunts dragons.</text>
<text id="58000540">Hrrmmm...</text>
<text id="58000550">Haah!</text>
<text id="58000560">Hah hah! Yes, a truer shot was never loosed!</text>
<text id="58000570">That bat will be grounded for a good spell!</text>
<text id="58000580">The rest is in thine hands. I await good tidings.</text>
<text id="58000590">Ahh, dragon slaying. Knighthood's highest calling...</text>
<text id="58000600">...Strange. I am rarely wrong on such matters...</text>
<text id="58000700">A wise choice.
Why foist thyself unto the fiery maw?</text>
<text id="58000800">The Black Dragon troubles you yet, I see.</text>
<text id="58000900">...Hmm, yes, I see. I was mistaken...</text>
<text id="58001000">...Art thou prepared to challenge great Kalameet?</text>
<text id="58001100">Yes, surely that is best.</text>
<text id="58001200">Ah, hello there. What of Kalameet?</text>
<text id="58001210">He is an ancient dragon.
Skyward or no, he will not be put down easily.</text>
<text id="58001300">Why, thou hast defeated Kalameet!</text>
<text id="58001310">Wondrously played. Lord Gwyn's blessing upon thee.</text>
<text id="58001320">That beast will never take to the skies again.</text>
<text id="58001400">Farewell, human.</text>
<text id="58001410">Lead thy life as thou seest fit.</text>
<text id="58001500">Farewell, human.</text>
<text id="58001510">I await good tidings.</text>
<text id="58001600">Farewell, proud human.</text>
<text id="58001610">May every honour be bestowed upon thee.</text>
<text id="58001700">If thou seeketh to explore this domain, be wary of a black dragon.</text>
<text id="58001710">I fear thee no match for this terrible beast.</text>
<text id="58001800">I should confer...If thine was the blade to which Artorias fell.</text>
<text id="58001810">Then thou must be wary of Ciaran.</text>
<text id="58001820">She had strong feelings for the great Artorias.</text>
<text id="58001830">The poor, poor girl.</text>
<text id="58001900">Me?</text>
<text id="58001910">There is very little to be said.</text>
<text id="58001920">What good is a dog, with no hares to hunt?</text>
<text id="58001930">...I am lucky to be alive, I suppose.</text>
<text id="58002000">Now, do not mistake my words.</text>
<text id="58002010">I cherish my work.
Wood carving is a nuanced art.</text>
<text id="58002020">I would have much to talk about with that blacksmith.</text>
<text id="58002030">In truth, how is the old chap, I wonder?</text>
<text id="58002040">Still hammering away, I should hope.</text>
<text id="58002100">The dragons shall never be forgotten...</text>
<text id="58002110">We knights fought valiantly,
but for every one of them, we lost three score of our own.</text>
<text id="58002120">Exhilaration, pride, hatred, rage...
The dragons teased out our dearest emotions.</text>
<text id="58002130">...Thou will understand, one day.</text>
<text id="58002140">At thy twilight, old thoughts return,
in great waves of nostalgia.</text>
<text id="58002200">Ahh, this Greatbow?</text>
<text id="58002210">I shan't need it, with no dragons to hunt.</text>
<text id="58002220">I know not if a human could even operate it, but here...</text>
<text id="58002230">Thy need outweighs mine.</text>
<text id="58002300">Hm? A visitor, have we?</text>
<text id="58002310">Thou must be the one who freed Artorias.</text>
<text id="58002320">An old friend he was,
and thanks to thee...</text>
<text id="58002330">He left this world with honour intact.</text>
<text id="58002340">And I see that the great black dragon Kalameet
is dusted by thine hand.</text>
<text id="58002350">Wondrously played. Lord Gwyn's blessing upon thee.</text>
<text id="58002360">I am retired, and blind.</text>
<text id="58002370">To receive a visit by one as lofty as thyself,
is a great honour indeed.</text>
<text id="58002400">I see that thou hast dusted the great black dragon Kalameet.</text>
<text id="58002410">Wondrously played. Lord Gwyn's blessing upon thee.</text>
<text id="58002420">I see that there is at least one legend among ye humans.</text>
<text id="58002430">Dear me... That old bat will never fly again.</text>
<text id="58002500">Thou com'st again, legend of humans.</text>
<text id="58002510">It is always an honour to speak with thee.</text>
<text id="58002600">I suspect thou hast taken a gander at it,</text>
<text id="58002610">But the Dark of the Abyss, which swallowed poor Artorias,
threatens to devour our entire land of Oolacile.</text>
<text id="58002620">It seems that this dire fate is unavoidable.</text>
<text id="58002630">But, seduced by a Dark serpent or no,</text>
<text id="58002640">They awoke that thing themselves, and drove it mad.</text>
<text id="58002650">...One's demise is always one's own making.</text>
<text id="58002700">If thine wish is to succeed poor Artorias,
and challenge the spread of the Dark,</text>
<text id="58002710">Then thou must face Manus, Father of the Abyss.</text>
<text id="58002720">The Dark emanates from Manus himself.</text>
<text id="58002730">Even if this land shall expire,
thou may be able to prevent further corrosion.</text>
<text id="58002740">...But even so, one day the flames will fade,
and only Dark will remain.</text>
<text id="58002750">And even a legend such as thineself can do nothing to stop that.</text>
<text id="58005000">Cease this.</text>
<text id="58005010">Stop it, I say.</text>
<text id="58005020">Understand this. I wish thee no harm.</text>
<text id="58005030">Stop that!</text>
<text id="58005040">By the Gods!</text>
<text id="58005100">Ahh, so this is true human nature.</text>
<text id="58005110">Artorias is in your debt, but thou leavest me little choice...</text>
<text id="58005120">May you perish, for the good of all!</text>
<text id="58005200">Mmgraah!</text>
<text id="58005210">Mmgraah!</text>
<text id="58005220">Hahh...</text>
<text id="58005300">Oog!</text>
<text id="58005310">Ooph!</text>
<text id="58005320">Hrg!</text>
<text id="58005400">Arrgggg!</text>
<text id="58005410">Humans...hmph...</text>
<text id="58005420">What vile creatures...</text>
<text id="58006000">Hello</text>
<text id="58006001">Thank you</text>
<text id="58006002">Very good!</text>
<text id="58006003">I'm sorry!</text>
<text id="58006004">Help me!</text>
