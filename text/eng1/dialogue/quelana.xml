<text>#0Talk-1st time (after upgrading a Pyromancy Flame to +10)</text>
<text id="27000000">Hmm...A mere Undead, yet you can see me? Fascinating...</text>
<text id="27000001">I am Quelana of Izalith.</text>
<text id="27000002">I am not often revealed to walkers of flesh. You have a gift.</text>
<text id="27000003">Are you, too, one who seeks my pyromancy?</text>
<text id="27000004">Like Salaman.</text>
<text>#0Choose "No" to the 1st query</text>
<text id="27000040">Hmm, very well. Then we are done.</text>
<text id="27000041">You have spoken. Now away with you.</text>
<text>#0After choosing "No" to the 1st query</text>
<text id="27000060">What? Considering my pyromancy?</text>
<text>#0Choose "Yes" to the 1st query</text>
<text id="27000020">Yes, of course. It should be expected.</text>
<text id="27000021">Very well. You shall be my pupil.</text>
<text id="27000022">But to pursue my pyromancy, you must give something up.</text>
<text id="27000023">Are you prepared to do this?</text>
<text>#0After choosing "Yes" to the 1st or 2nd query-1st time</text>
<text id="27000100">Ah, there you are.</text>
<text id="27000101">I was expecting you. Let us begin.</text>
<text>#0After choosing "Yes" to the 1st or 2nd query-2nd time</text>
<text id="27000120">Ah, you again.</text>
<text id="27000121">I applaud your diligence, but what have you brought for me?</text>
<text>#0After choosing "Yes" to the 1st or 2nd query-3rd time</text>
<text id="27000120">Ah, you again.</text>
<text id="27000122">I applaud your diligence.</text>
<text>#0After choosing "Yes" to the 1st or 2nd query-4th time</text>
<text id="27000140">Ah. It has been some time.</text>
<text id="27000141">Truth be told, I thought you had perished.</text>
<text>#0Menu-Choose "Talk" 1st time</text>
<text id="27000900">Long ago, I accepted another pupil, like yourself.</text>
<text id="27000901">Over two-hundred years ago,
there was a man, almost as bungling as you...</text>
<text id="27000902">In your world he was called Salaman the Master Pyromancer.</text>
<text id="27000903">The little rascal really made something of himself.</text>
<text>#0Menu-Choose "Talk" 2nd time</text>
<text id="27001000">Pyromancy is the art of invoking and manipulating fire.</text>
<text id="27001001">But remember one thing.</text>
<text id="27001002">Always fear the flame,
lest you be devoured by it, and lose yourself.</text>
<text id="27001003">I would hate to see that happen again...</text>
<text>#0Menu-Choose "Talk" 3rd time</text>
<text id="27001100">The Witch of Izalith?</text>
<text id="27001101">...Please, do not speak of her.</text>
<text id="27001102">...I abandoned my mother and sisters and fled to this land.</text>
<text id="27001103">...Now I roam these parts, feigning ablution,</text>
<text id="27001104">and pretending to seek answers.</text>
<text>#0Menu-Choose "Talk" 4th time</text>
<text id="27001200">...Hmm...</text>
<text id="27001201">I have a favour to ask...</text>
<text id="27001202">My mother, the Witch of Izalith, was one of the primeval Lords...</text>
<text id="27001203">Her power came from the soul
that she found near the First Flame.</text>
<text id="27001204">...She focused this power to light a flame of her own,
but she failed to control it.</text>
<text id="27001205">The Flame of Chaos engulfed Mother and my sisters,
and moulded them into deformed creatures.</text>
<text id="27001206">Only I escaped, and now I am here.</text>
<text id="27001207">But my mother and sisters have been in anguish since.</text>
<text id="27001208">I beseech you.
Free Mother and my sisters from the Flame of Chaos.</text>
<text id="27001209">I cannot do it myself; I lack the strength, and the bravery...</text>
<text id="27001210">...But you...</text>
<text id="27001211">I realize what I am asking.
But please, free their poor souls...</text>
<text id="27001212">Mother's ambitions were misguided, no doubt,
but surely a thousand years of atonement is enough!</text>
<text>#0Menu-Choose "Leave" without purchasing something 1st time</text>
<text id="27000200">No luck, hmm...</text>
<text id="27000201">Well, young pupil, you must have patience.</text>
<text id="27000203">But do not keep me waiting much longer.</text>
<text>#0Menu-Choose "Leave" without purchasing something 2nd time</text>
<text id="27000200">No luck, hmm...</text>
<text id="27000202">Do not let it bother you.</text>
<text>#0Menu-Choose "Leave" after purchasing something 1st time</text>
<text id="27000300">Now, go.</text>
<text id="27000302">Whatever you do, do not crack and go Hollow.</text>
<text id="27000304">Lest my time spent on you be wasted.</text>
<text>#0Menu-Choose "Leave" after purchasing something 2nd time</text>
<text id="27000300">Now, go.</text>
<text id="27000303">Don't you dare let yourself go Hollow.</text>
<text id="27000304">Lest my time spent on you be wasted.</text>
<text>#0Menu-Choose "Leave" with all pyromancies &amp; Pyromancy Flame +5 ascended</text>
<text id="27000320">Ah, very well.</text>
<text id="27000321">There is nothing left for me to teach you.</text>
<text id="27000322">Our time together is done. It was short, but sweet.</text>
<text>#0Talk-After purchasing all her pyromancies &amp; Pyromancy Flame +5 ascended</text>
<text id="27000340">Fool. Hurry along.</text>
<text id="27000342">I can do nothing more for you.</text>
<text>#0Talk-After defeating the Bed of Chaos</text>
<text id="27001300">Outstanding...You have done very well.</text>
<text id="27001301">Thank you. I am blessed to have met you.</text>
<text id="27001302">I suppose I can call you fool no longer...</text>
<text id="27001400">I can hardly thank you enough.</text>
<text id="27001401">Please take this...It is all of me.</text>
<text>#0After leaving abruptly</text>
<text id="27000400">Hm? What's the rush?</text>
<text>#0Talk-After leaving abruptly</text>
<text id="27000500">What was that? You are a peculiar one.</text>
<text>#0Upon being attacked-1st time</text>
<text id="27000640">What is it! Fool!</text>
<text>#0Upon being attacked-2nd time</text>
<text id="27000660">Stop that!</text>
<text>#0Upon being attacked &amp; made hostile</text>
<text id="27000700">Hmm...The voice of reason fails?</text>
<text id="27000701">Then here is a lesson for you...</text>
<text id="27000702">That you can only learn once!</text>
<text>#0Upon dying</text>
<text id="27000800">Farewell, my mother, my sisters...</text>
<text id="27000801">What have you done...</text>
<text id="27000301">##Yes, now go.</text>
