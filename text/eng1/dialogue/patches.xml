<text>#0Talk-Meeting before he has activated the rotating bridge trap</text>
<text id="42000000">Good day! You look reasonably sane!</text>
<text id="42000001">What are you doing in the Catacombs?
Are you a cleric or something?</text>
<text>#0After choosing "No" to being a cleric</text>
<text id="42000040">No? Well, that's strange.</text>
<text id="42000041">Ohhh, I know what it is.
You've come for the trinkets, haven't you?</text>
<text id="42000042">Well, whatever it is...</text>
<text id="42000043">This place is treacherous. Do watch your step.</text>
<text id="42000044">Heh heh heh...</text>
<text>#0After choosing "Yes" to being a cleric</text>
<text id="42000020">Yes, I imagined as much.</text>
<text id="42000021">Best of luck with your pilgrimages
or missions or whatever you do.</text>
<text id="42000022">This place is treacherous. Do watch your step, eh?</text>
<text id="42000023">Heh heh heh...</text>
<text>#0Talk-After choosing "Yes" to being a cleric</text>
<text id="42000100">Yeah? What is it now?</text>
<text id="42000101">Enough with the chit-chat.
In a place like this, we need to stay on our toes.</text>
<text>#0Talk-1st time, after he activated the rotating bridge trap, but before meeting</text>
<text id="42000200">Ah, oh! Well, well, how are you, then?</text>
<text id="42000201">I, uh, sort of lost my way, yes...</text>
<text id="42000202">But when I came here,
I didn't touch any levers, no, not me!</text>
<text id="42000203">Very peculiar, isn't it?
Wait, did something happen to you?</text>
<text id="42000204">Hey, don't look at me like that.
I'm Trusty Patches, the one-and-only!</text>
<text id="42000205">Here, everything's good with us, eh? Aww, c'mon, take it!</text>
<text id="42000206">Heh heh. We'll be wonderful friends.</text>
<text id="42000207">Heh heh heh...</text>
<text>#0Talk-2nd time, after he activated the rotating bridge trap, but before meeting</text>
<text id="42000300">Oh, does it really matter that much?</text>
<text id="42000301">C'mon, now. What exactly do you think I did?</text>
<text id="42000302">You're not making sense, my friend.</text>
<text id="42000303">Heh heh heh...</text>
<text>#0Talk-1st time, after meeting &amp; he has activated the rotating bridge trap</text>
<text id="42000400">Ah, oh! Well, how are you, then?</text>
<text id="42000401">...I slipped and flipped that lever, you see...</text>
<text id="42000402">...It didn't cause you any trouble, by chance?</text>
<text>#0Choose "No" to the query</text>
<text id="42000600">Oh, really? Yes, I see...Righty-oh!</text>
<text id="42000601">Then, everything's good, isn't it?</text>
<text id="42000602">I'm Trusty Patches, the one-and-only!</text>
<text id="42000603">You and I, just a couple of Undead outcasts, right mate?</text>
<text id="42000604">You and I, just a couple of Undead outcasts, right my darling?</text>
<text id="42000605">Heh heh heh...</text>
<text>#0Choose "Yes" to the query</text>
<text id="42000500">Are you certain?!</text>
<text id="42000501">Well, that's a fine shame. Oh, I'm truly sorry, really!</text>
<text id="42000502">But, wait now, you didn't actually fall down, then?</text>
<text id="42000503">Well, why didn't you tell me sooner!
All's well that ends well!</text>
<text id="42000504">Everybody makes mistakes. I'm not above it all, I swear!</text>
<text id="42000505">I'm Trusty Patches, the one-and-only!</text>
<text id="42000506">I know! This should make up for it.</text>
<text id="42000507">We're on the same side! Undead outcasts!</text>
<text id="42000508">Fantastic, isn't it?</text>
<text id="42000509">Heh heh heh...</text>
<text>#0Talk-2nd time after choosing Yes" to the query</text>
<text id="42000700">Oh, will you come off it, now!</text>
<text id="42000701">You're fine and well, so what's the difference!</text>
<text id="42000702">Nobody likes a crybaby, you know?</text>
<text id="42000703">Heh heh heh...</text>
<text>#0Talk-1st time without previously speaking in the Catacombs</text>
<text id="42010000">Good day! You look reasonably sane!</text>
<text id="42010001">What are you doing in the Catacombs?
Are you a cleric or something?</text>
<text>#0After choosing "No" to being a cleric</text>
<text id="42010200">No? Really?</text>
<text id="42010201">Then I'd have no qualms telling you,</text>
<text id="42010202">there's a fine stash of treasure right down that hole.</text>
<text id="42010203">I found it first, but...
well, we're friends now, so I'll split it with you!</text>
<text id="42010204">In any case, have a look, it'll shimmer you blind!</text>
