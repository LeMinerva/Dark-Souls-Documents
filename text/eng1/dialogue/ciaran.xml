<text id="60000010">...Why have you the ring of Artorias?</text>
<text id="60000011">...Why have you the soul of Artorias?</text>
<text id="60000020">...I am Ciaran, and that is a keepsake.</text>
<text id="60000100">...That ring...</text>
<text id="60000110">It was purloined by a man in a long coat...</text>
<text id="60000120">I know not how you came upon it,</text>
<text id="60000130">but its owner met his death here.</text>
<text id="60000140">He was a dear companion,
and I wish to return the ring to his grave.</text>
<text id="60000150">Would you be willing to part with it?</text>
<text id="60000200">Thank you. You are very kind.</text>
<text id="60000210">Please take this. I no longer need it.</text>
<text id="60000220">May the Lord guide thee.</text>
<text id="60000300">Yes, of course...</text>
<text id="60000310">...</text>
<text id="60000320">...I must not be presumptuous.</text>

<text id="60000410">Have you changed your mind?</text>
<text id="60000500">...Then you have no business with me...</text>
<text id="60000600">...Are you human?</text>
<text id="60000610">...I forgive you.</text>
<text id="60000620">I am here to pay respects to a dear friend.</text>
<text id="60000630">Please, allow me a moment alone.</text>
<text id="60000700">...You, is that not...</text>
<text id="60000710">The soul of the man who fell on this spot?</text>
<text id="60000720">He was a dear friend.
I wish to pay proper respect, with that soul.</text>
<text id="60000730">Would you be willing to part with it?</text>
<text id="60005000">Hmph, you humans...</text>
<text id="60005010">...always taking what you please. Then, I shall do the same.</text>
<text id="60005011">...always resorting to force. Then, I shall do the same.</text>
<text id="60005100">Hrk!</text>
<text id="60005110">Erg!</text>
<text id="60005120">Ooh!</text>
<text id="60005200">Hmph, such conceit...</text>
<text id="60005210">How did you imagine that the Lord's Blade would not reach you?</text>
<text id="60005300">But, how...</text>
