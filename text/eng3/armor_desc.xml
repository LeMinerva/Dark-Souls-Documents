<text id="63500000">The hood of the Ringed Knights.

These knights don Abyss-tainted black cloth,

that rose from an abyssal swamp.

The white-faced locusts were meant to
beckon men to the dark with sermons,
but most of them are unable
to think past their own stomachs.
Someone must rise to the occasion,
and restore the path of righteousness.

Perhaps that someone is you?
Did you not arise from the Abyss,
and did you not resist drowning in the Age of Fire?
Locusts and men are kindred spirits.
Why not don this head, and join them in likeness?</text>
