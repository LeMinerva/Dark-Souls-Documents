<text id="9000002">Then these red eyes are for you.</text>
<text id="9000003">Use them to pillage embers,

<text id="9000200">Well, hasn't it been some time.</text>
<text id="9000201">I'm Leonhard, the Ringfinger.</text>
<text id="9000203">Remember me? I slipped you those red eyes some time ago.</text>
<text id="9000204">You're making quite an effort of it.
So I thought you might like to know.</text>
<text id="9000205">If you yearn for a proper red eye orb, one that is uncracked...</text>
<text id="9000206">Then kill the Darkwraith,
survivor of the land swallowed by darkness.</text>
<text id="9000207">He has been a prisoner, for many ages.
In the deepest cell in all Lothric...</text>
<text id="9000209">I can see it in your eyes.
If you didn't invade, didn't pillage, whatever would you do?</text>

<text id="9000500">Ah-hah, you've found a proper red eye...</text>
<text id="9000501">Brilliant. I knew you were no ordinary man.</text>
<text id="9000502">Brilliant. I knew you were a dangerous woman.</text>
<text id="9000503">Now invade and pillage all you like.</text>
<text id="9000504">And if you grow weary of your duty,
you, too, may become a Finger.</text>
<text id="9000505">Come on, give yourself to Rosaria, of the Cathedral of the Deep.</text>

<text id="9002104">Can you even hear me? If you can, cease this at once.</text>

<text>#0Upon being attacked &amp; made hostile</text>
<text id="9002200">I see, I see, as clear as day.</text>
<text id="9002201">You are a vile, starved beast.</text>
<text id="9002202">Much too dangerous for her!</text>

<text id="9000700">Ahh, so you've chosen to serve Rosaria after all.</text>
<text id="9000701">She will be pleased with me for finding her another Finger...</text>
<text id="9000702">...</text>
<text id="9000703">But be warned, my friend.</text>
<text id="9000704">Rosaria's Fingers need only fetch tongues for their mistress.</text>
<text id="9000705">Otherwise, we are free, unchained.</text>
<text id="9000706">Like Yellowfinger,
you can choose to believe that all Fingers share camaraderie.</text>

<text>#0After invading him as a Dark Phantom</text>
<text id="9001500">Well, well, never expected to see you here.</text>
<text id="9001501">Couldn't resist her any longer, in all her festering glory?</text>
<text id="9001502">Felt sorry for the poor thing, in all her festering glory?</text>
<text id="9001503">And now you want to ravage her soul, as well.</text>
<text id="9001504">I sowed the seeds. I'll prune the mess.</text>

<text id="9001600">Well, well, back for more, are you?</text>
<text id="9001601">No ordinary man, are you. I knew it all along.</text>
<text id="9001602">Vicious one, aren't you. I knew it all along.</text>
<text id="9001603">And now you want to ravage her soul, as well.</text>
<text id="9001604">You are no longer of use. You'll run free no more.</text>

<text id="9001700">No one will despoil her soul.</text>
<text id="9001701">Certainly no beast wrapped in human skin!</text>
<text>#0After his health has dropped below 30%</text>
<text id="9001800">What do you want with her soul?</text>
<text id="9001801">Isn't flesh enough for a sick beast!</text>
<text>#0Upon killing the protagonist</text>
<text id="9002000">Enough with you, my friend.</text>
