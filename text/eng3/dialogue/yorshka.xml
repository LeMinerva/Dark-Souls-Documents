<text id="6000000">Name thyself, stranger.</text>
<text id="6000001">I am Yorshka. Captain of the Darkmoon Knights.</text>
<text id="6000002">What beckoned thee to such a place?</text>
<text>#0Choose "Do Nothing" to the 1st query</text>
<text id="6000200">If thou'st come stumbling here in error,
I bid thee leave anon.</text>
<text id="6000201">This tower is a prison.
Thy presence shall invoke the ire of the tyrant, Sulyvahn.</text>
<text id="6000202">Though 'twas a rare delight to converse with another.
My thanks, strange visitor.</text>
<text id="6000203">May the Darkmoon watch over thee.</text>
<text>#0Talk-After choosing "Do Nothing" to the 1st query</text>
<text id="6000300">Thou think'st to remain?</text>
<text id="6000301">This tower is a prison.
Thy presence shall invoke the ire of the tyrant, Sulyvahn.</text>
<text id="6000302">I bid thee leave, anon.</text>
<text id="6000303">May the Darkmoon watch over thee.</text>
<text>#0Choose "Perform Darkmoon Loyalty" to either the 1st or 2nd query</text>
<text id="6000100">Thou think'st to-</text>
<text id="6000101">Very well. Captain to this knightless company, I remain.</text>
<text id="6000102">I will grant thee purpose.</text>
<text id="6000103">Thou'st journeyed far; hear my voice.</text>
<text id="6000104">If thou shalt swear by the Covenant, to become</text>
<text id="6000105">A shadow of Father Gwyn and Sister Gwynevere,</text>
<text id="6000106">A blade that shall hunt the foes of our Lords;</text>
<text id="6000107">Then I place thee under the aegis,
and the power, of the Darkmoon.</text>
<text id="6000108">Thou'rt now a Blade of the Darkmoon.</text>
<text id="6000109">The only knight of our company.</text>
<text id="6000110">Swear this oath, and face thy solemn duty.</text>
<text>#0Kneel-After joining the Blade of the Darkmoon Covenant</text>
<text id="6000500">Oh, good Blade of the Darkmoon, welcome home.</text>
<text id="6000501">If I can provide thee succour, only tell me how.</text>
<text>#0Menu-Choose "Talk" 1st time</text>
<text id="6000700">Long ago, our father Gwyn,
lamenting the waning of the fire, became cinder of his own will.</text>
<text id="6000701">Now, the fire is linked by the champions
who have come in his stead.</text>
<text id="6000702">Such is the will of father, and the gods.
And so the Darkmoon knights took arms,
to watch over those who link the fire.</text>
<text id="6000703">But long ago, our company lost its last proper knight.</text>
<text id="6000704">Only its covenant was preserved, to this day,
until the time of thy visit.</text>
<text id="6000705">Heirdom taketh many forms, indeed.</text>
<text>#0Menu-Choose "Talk" 2nd time</text>
<text id="6000800">May I pose thee a question?</text>
<text id="6000801">This tower, this prison, stands tall and solitary,
the contraption bridging its lower reaches long unmoving.</text>
<text id="6000802">So...by what path didst thou here ascend?</text>
<text id="6000803">Art thou a creature of the air, or other winged thing?</text>
<text>#0Choose "No, I can't fly" to the 3rd query</text>
<text id="6001000">No, of course not.</text>
<text id="6001001">Forgive my prying. Think no more on mine asking.</text>
<text id="6001002">I am ashamed to say, I know very little, of anything...</text>
<text>#0Choose "Yes, I can fly" to the 3rd query</text>
<text id="6000900">Oh, my! I imagined it might be so.</text>
<text id="6000901">Then thou'rt a dragon, or perhaps a crow?</text>
<text id="6000902">Well, whatever thou beest, thou'rt wondrous strange,
yet strangely familiar, visitor.</text>
<text id="6000903">...</text>

<text id="6001100">The Darkmoon Knights were once led by my elder brother,
the Dark Sun Gwyndolin.</text>
<text id="6001101">But he was stricken by illness,
and leadership of the knights fell to me.</text>
<text id="6001102">Then Sulyvahn wrongfully proclaimed himself Pontiff,
and took me prisoner.</text>
<text id="6001103">Oh where could my dear brother be?</text>
<text id="6001104">If only he were here, I would be most pleased for ye both to meet.</text>
<text id="6001105">As, most assuredly, would he.</text>

'tis my duty to honour knights of great accomplishment.</text>

<text id="6001901">I, Yorshka, captain of this company, hereby recognise thy service.</text>
<text id="6001802">This is a wonder of the Darkmoon,
inherited from my brother for this very purpose.</text>
<text id="6001902">Please, take this. Thou'rt most deserving of it.</text>
<text id="6001903">As a shade of Father Gwyn
and Sister Gwynevere,</text>
<text id="6001904">Persevere in thy knightly duty,
hunting down the gods' would-be foes.</text>
<text id="6001905">...I would speak to my brother of this, one day.
Of the shining new hope that joined our dear company.</text>
<text id="6001906">I speak of thee, of course.</text>

I'm certain thou'st given my brother peace.</text>
