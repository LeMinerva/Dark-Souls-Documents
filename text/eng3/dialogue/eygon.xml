<text id="17000001">All you faceless Undead, behaving as if you deserve respect.</text>
<text id="17000002">Hmph. No matter. Heed my words.</text>
<text id="17000003">If you've any sense, you'll go find a coffin to huddle up inside.</text>
<text id="17000004">You here, in this land of Hollows,
you're like a frail maiden on the front lines.</text>
<text id="17000005">If like the others, you're fool enough to play the champion...</text>
<text id="17000006">Then go on ahead, traipse right past the abandoned church.</text>
<text id="17000007">You'll face death, and it won't be pretty.</text>
<text id="17000008">Enough death to leave you broken, time after time.</text>
<text id="17000009">...</text>
<text id="17000100">If like the others, you're fool enough to play the champion...</text>
<text id="17000101">Then go on ahead, traipse right past the abandoned church.</text>
<text id="17000102">Hopeless, the whole lot of you.
Like little moths, flittering toward a flame.</text>
<text id="17000103">...</text>
<text id="17000200">You like poking around in cells, do you?</text>
<text id="17000201">How very genteel!</text>
<text id="17000202">...</text>
<text id="17000300">Ah-hah, taken an interest in her, have you?</text>
<text id="17000301">Well, she's a lost cause.
Couldn't even become a Fire Keeper.</text>
<text id="17000302">After I brought her all this way,
and got her all ready.</text>
<text id="17000303">She's beyond repair, I tell you.</text>
<text id="17000304">...</text>
<text id="17000400">The woman's a lost cause.</text>
<text id="17000401">Couldn't even become a Fire Keeper.</text>

<text id="17000500">Hmm... Another one of those Unkindled, are you?</text>
<text id="17000501">All you faceless Undead, behaving as if you deserve respect.</text>
<text id="17000502">Now you're poking around in peoples' cells.</text>
<text id="17000503">How very noble!</text>
<text id="17000504">...</text>
<text id="17000600">You've gone and rescued her, have you?</text>
<text id="17000601">How very quaint, pitying creatures that are beyond help.</text>
<text id="17000602">...</text>
<text id="17000603">Very well. I'm sick of looking after her at any rate.</text>
<text id="17000604">I am Eygon, a knight of Carim.</text>
<text id="17000605">I am allied to you as long as you assure the girl's safety.</text>
<text id="17000606">And only for that long...</text>
<text id="17000700">What's the matter? My terms are very simple.</text>
<text id="17000701">I am allied to you for as long as you assure the girl's safety.</text>
<text id="17000702">And only for that long...</text>

<text id="17000808">And only for that long...</text>
<text id="17000900">Ahh, I know you. Been some time, since we met in person.</text>
<text id="17000901">Ahh, I know you. Been some time.</text>
<text id="17000902">I just dropped in to see how she's getting on.</text>
<text id="17000903">Now, what are you playing at with this circus?</text>
<text id="17000904">This cesspool of
doddering oldfolk and degenerates.</text>
<text id="17000905">Couldn't be better. She must fit in perfectly here.</text>
<text id="17000906">...</text>
<text id="17001000">This place is a cesspool of
doddering oldfolk and degenerates.</text>
<text id="17001001">Couldn't hope for better. She must fit in perfectly here.</text>
<text id="17001002">...</text>
<text id="17001100">I made myself very clear.</text>
<text id="17001101">My allegiance remained only
as long as you assured the girl's safety.</text>
<text id="17001102">This knight of Carim does not forgive betrayal.</text>
<text id="17001103">Even a broken woman deserves her dignity... </text>
<text id="17001200">...</text>
<text id="17001201">...</text>
<text id="17001203">What is it now!</text>
<text id="17001204">Curse you, damn fool!</text>
<text id="17001300">Lost it, have you?</text>
<text id="17001301">Then I'll take care of you.</text>
<text id="17001302">As many times as it takes!</text>
<text id="17001400">Stay dead this time.</text>
<text id="17001500">...</text>
<text id="17001502">Deluded Hollow bastard...</text>
<text id="17001600">Remember. A knight of Carim does not forgive betrayal.</text>
<text id="17001601">Not ever.</text>
<text id="17001700">...</text>
