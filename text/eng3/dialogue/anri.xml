<text id="19000000">Oh, hello. How do you do.</text>
<text id="19000001">I am Anri of Astora.
Unkindled, like you.</text>
<text id="19010001">I'm Anri of Astora.
Unkindled, like you.</text>
<text id="19000002">This is Horace. A friend and travelling companion.</text>
<text id="19000003">Are you too in search of the Lords of Cinder?</text>
<text id="19000004">We are well along the road of sacrifices.
Below us is the Crucifixion Woods.</text>
<text id="19000005">Beyond the flooded woods lies Farron Keep,
home of the Undead Legion.
Further yet is the Cathedral of the Deep.</text>
<text id="19000006">We seek the cathedral,
home of the grim Aldrich.</text>
<text id="19010006">We seek the cathedral,
home of the grim Aldrich.</text>
<text id="19000007">We may go our separate ways now,
but we are both seekers of lords.</text>
<text id="19000008">The next time we cross paths,
one may find the other in a time of need.</text>
<text id="19000009">May the flames guide your way.</text>
<text>#0Talk-2nd time</text>
<text id="19000100">Oh, yes, Horace...</text>
<text id="19000101">He's not very talkative.</text>
<text id="19000102">But don't think ill of him. He's an upstanding,
kind-hearted knight, a fine partner for this gruelling journey.</text>
<text id="19010102">But don't think ill of him. He is an upstanding,

<text id="19000103">Without his help, I would have cursed this onerous duty long ago.</text>

<text>#0Talk-1st time</text>
<text id="19000300">Oh, and we meet again.</text>
<text id="19000301">We spoke before on the road of sacrifices. Anri of Astora.</text>
<text id="19000302">I am well pleased to see you safe.</text>
<text id="19010302">I am well pleased to see you safe.</text>
<text id="19000303">We reached the Cathedral of the Deep,
but Aldrich's coffin was empty.</text>
<text id="19000304">The man-eater must have left for his true home.</text>
<text id="19000305">The little doll in the empty coffin told me.</text>
<text id="19000306">Aldrich is said to hail from Irithyll in the Boreal Valley,
an ancient fabled city...</text>
<text id="19000307">A pilgrim told me that the city
lies beyond Farron Keep.</text>
<text id="19000308">And so becomes our destination...</text>
<text>#0Talk-2nd time</text>
<text id="19000400">Aldrich's honest home is Irithyll in the Boreal Valley,

<text>#0Talk-1st time</text>
<text id="19000500">Oh, hello, how very fortunate.</text>
<text id="19000501">Have you seen my companion, Horace?</text>
<text id="19000502">To my shame, I was snared by a trap, and we've become separated.</text>
<text id="19000503">I've not been able to find him since.</text>
<text>#0Choose "No" to the 1st query</text>
<text id="19000600">Yes, I see.</text>
<text id="19000601">Horace is a valiant knight. He can look after himself, no question.</text>
<text id="19000602">He's probably searching for me right now, with twice the resolve.</text>
<text id="19000603">If you happen upon him, please tell him.</text>
<text id="19000604">That I remain in the catacombs...</text>
<text id="19000605">And will lay prism stones to guide him, as always.</text>
<text id="19000606">Please send him my word, I beg of you.</text>
<text id="19010606">Please send him word, I beg of you.</text>

<text id="19000800">Ah, hello, we meet again.</text>
<text id="19000801">Have you seen Horace anywhere?</text>
<text>#0Talk-2nd time after choosing "No" to the 2nd query</text>
<text id="19001100">Oh, yes, I see...</text>
<text id="19001101">I've searched high and low, with no luck.
Perhaps he's left the catacombs.</text>
<text id="19001102">Oh, Horace. Where have you run off to?</text>
<text>#0Choose "No" to the 2nd query, or choosing "Say nothing" to the 3rd query</text>
<text id="19001200">Oh, Horace. Where have you run off to?</text>
<text id="19001201">Have you abandoned me?
No, what a horrible thought...</text>
<text>#0Choose "Tell of the Smouldering Lake" to the 2nd or 3rd query</text>
<text id="19000900">Goodness me.</text>
<text id="19000901">To think there'd be a lake so deep within these catacombs.</text>
<text id="19010901">To think there'd be a lake so deep within these catacombs.</text>
<text id="19000902">What a relief.
I knew that Horace was alive, and wouldn't stray far.</text>
<text id="19000903">Thank you. We are both in your debt.</text>
<text id="19000904">This hardly expresses my gratitude,
but it'll have to do for now.</text>
<text id="19000905">Please, take it.
And may the flames guide your way.</text>
<text>#0Talk-After choosing "Tell of the Smouldering Lake" to the 2nd or 3rd query</text>
<text id="19001000">I will soon head to the lake.</text>
<text id="19001001">Thank you. We are both in your debt.</text>

<text>#0Talk-1st time after choosing "No" or "Say nothing"</text>
<text id="19001300">Oh, I thought it might be you. Good to see you.</text>
<text id="19001301">I never managed to find Horace.</text>
<text id="19001302">But my duty must be done, even alone.
As an unkindled Lordseeker.</text>
<text id="19001303">For the children I knew,
bless their souls.</text>
<text id="19001304">We all have our reasons, don't we?</text>
<text id="19001305">Please, take this.
Recompense for my foolish request.</text>
<text id="19001306">And also a token of protection.
May the flames guide your way.</text>

<text id="19001400">Ahh, you are brave indeed. To face your duty alone.</text>
<text id="19001401">I would do well to learn from you.</text>
