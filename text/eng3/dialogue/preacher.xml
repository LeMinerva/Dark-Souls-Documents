<text id="75000000">Many of us are by the fire forsaken.</text>
<text id="75000001">I speak of thine kind, and mine.</text>
<text id="75000002">Behold this city!
We are kindred, belike two eyes which gaze upon the other.</text>
<text id="75000003">Fear not, the dark, my friend.</text>
<text id="75000004">And let the feast begin.</text>
<text>#0Talk-1st time </text>
<text id="75000300">One was a wayfaring knight, on an endless, forbidden search.</text>
<text id="75000301">Only the Abyss granted closure,
if not reunion with his beloved.</text>
<text id="75000302">Fear not, the dark, my friend.</text>
<text id="75000303">And let the feast begin.</text>
<text>#0After approaching his location, or talking a 2nd time</text>
<text id="75000100">One met the dark with learning.
But in the end, learned his knowledge was wanting.</text>
<text id="75000101">The world began without knowledge,
and without knowledge will it end.</text>
<text id="75000102">Dost not this ring clear and true?</text>
<text id="75000103">Fear not, the dark, my friend.</text>

<text>#0Talk-1st time </text>
<text id="75000200">One poor girl slew her own kin,
but even so, was embraced, enveloped by the Abyss.</text>
<text id="75000201">Twas a comfort that neither
moon nor sunless sky afforded her before.</text>
<text id="75000202">Fear not, the dark, my friend.</text>
<text id="75000203">And let the feast begin.</text>
<text>#0After approaching his location, or talking a 2nd time</text>
<text id="75000400">And so, she lived in fear. Of the dark,
of the things that gnawed at her flesh.</text>
<text id="75000401">And yet! The Abyss hath yet to produce any such creature!</text>
<text id="75000402">Fear not, the dark, my friend.</text>
<text id="75000403">And let the feast begin.</text>
<text>#0Talk-1st time </text>
<text id="75000500">And so, despite his weighty armour, he lived in fear.
Of a delicate thing, little more than a girl.</text>
<text id="75000501">Where fire resideth, shadows twist and shrivel.
But in the Abyss, there are shadows none.</text>
