<text id="52000000">Well...</text>
<text id="52000001">You look to be Unkindled.</text>
<text id="52000002">No bell tolls, and yet, you've slipped into the painting?</text>
<text id="52000003">Oh, no matter.</text>
<text id="52000004">If you've lost your way, the words of Lady Friede will guide you.</text>
<text id="52000005">##Now, go on ahead. Show respect, and listen carefully.</text>
<text id="52000006">Now, go on inside. Show respect, and listen carefully.</text>
<text id="52000100">##What's keeping you? Go on, straight ahead.</text>
<text id="52000101">What's keeping you? Go on, right inside.</text>
<text id="52000102">Show respect, and let Lady Friede speak to you.</text>
<text id="52000200">Lady Friede has spoken, has she not?</text>
<text id="52000201">Then tarry no longer and begone.</text>
<text id="52000300">There is one thing you should know.</text>
<text id="52000301">Inside the cold painting, curiosity could be your cross...</text>
<text id="52000302">Stray from the withering flame,
and the snow will swallow you whole.</text>
<text id="52000303">...</text>
<text id="52000400">Why you miserable, mad Hollow.</text>
<text id="52000401">You're nothing, without a bell to guide your way.</text>
<text id="52000402">...</text>
<text id="52000500">Well, well...</text>
<text id="52000501">You're Lady Yuria's Lord of Hollows.</text>
<text id="52000502">No bell tolls, and yet, you've slipped into the painting?</text>
<text id="52000503">Oh, no matter.</text>
<text id="52000504">If you've lost your way, the words of Lady Friede will guide you.</text>

<text id="52000600">Lady Friede has spoken, has she not?</text>
<text id="52000601">Then tarry no longer and begone.</text>
<text id="52000602">Carry on, for Lady Yuria, and for Londor.</text>
<text id="52000700">Why you miserable, mad Hollow.</text>
<text id="52000701">What is Lady Yuria thinking...</text>
<text id="52000800">I've seen your kind, time and time again.</text>
<text id="52000801">Every fleeing man must be caught. Every secret must be unearthed.
Such is the conceit of the self-proclaimed seeker of truth.</text>
<text id="52000802">But in the end, you lack the stomach.</text>

<text id="52001100">Forgive me, my Lady...</text>
<text id="52001101">I swore an oath, but I have failed you...</text>
<text id="52001102">...Lady Elfriede...</text>
