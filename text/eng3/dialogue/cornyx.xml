<text id="14000000">Ah-hah, Unkindled are we?</text>
<text id="14000001">Welcome to my abode.</text>
<text id="14000002">I am Cornyx, an old pyromancer.</text>
<text id="14000003">A crow in his cage, as you see, now.</text>
<text id="14000004">But here we are, an encounter for the ages!</text>
<text id="14000005">...</text>
<text id="14000006">I hear the Unkindled make for fine vessels.</text>
<text id="14000007">Care to learn some pyromancies from this old man?</text>
<text>#0Talk-1st time if chosen the Pyromancer class</text>
<text id="14000000">Ah-hah, Unkindled are we?</text>
<text id="14000001">Welcome to my abode.</text>
<text id="14000002">I am Cornyx, an old pyromancer.</text>
<text id="14000003">A crow in his cage, as you see, now.</text>
<text id="14000004">But here we are, an encounter for the ages!</text>
<text id="14000005">...</text>
<text id="14000006">I hear the Unkindled make for fine vessels.</text>
<text id="14002200">You've been dabbling in pyromancies, it seems?</text>
<text id="14002201">Well then, care to learn some pyromancies from this old man?</text>
<text>#0Choose "Decline" to the 1st query</text>
<text id="14000200">...</text>
<text id="14000201">Most foolish.
This old crow has a little knowledge of his own, you know.</text>
<text id="14000202">Bah. No sense in spelling it out.</text>
<text id="14000203">I will not rush you. You will return, once you are enlightened.</text>
<text id="14000204">We are, after all, both Undead.
And both prisoners, in our own ways.</text>
<text id="14000205">...</text>
<text>#0Talk-2nd time after choosing "Decline"</text>
<text id="14000300">Well, hello, That was certainly quick.</text>
<text id="14000302">Are you any more enlightened on this occasion?</text>
<text>#0Talk-2nd time after choosing "Decline", after the protagonist leaves &amp; returns</text>
<text id="14000301">Well, hello. You certainly took your time.</text>
<text id="14000302">Are you any more enlightened on this occasion?</text>
<text>#0Choose "Ask to learn pyromancy" to either the 1st or 2nd query</text>
<text id="14000100">...</text>
<text id="14000101">Most wise. A chance encounter should not be squandered.</text>
<text id="14000102">To reiterate, I am Cornyx, of the Great Swamp.</text>
<text id="14000103">The pleasure is mine.</text>
<text id="14000104">...</text>
<text>#0Upon being attacked-1st time</text>

<text>#0Upon being attacked-2nd time</text>
<text id="14000401">...</text>
<text>#0Upon being attacked-3rd time</text>
<text id="14000403">What are you doing?</text>
<text>#0Upon dying</text>
<text id="14000503">Little bird, what's to be gained?</text>
<text>#0Talk-1st time</text>
<text id="14000600">Ahh, there you are, Unkindled One.</text>
<text id="14000601">I wish to express my gratitude.</text>
<text id="14000602">For trusting a lowly pyromancer,
and allowing me to gaze upon this majestic flame.</text>
<text id="14000603">As promised, I will impart pyromancies to you.</text>
<text id="14000604">But first, you'll need a flame of your own.</text>
<text id="14000605">Careful you don't burn yourself with it.</text>
<text id="14000606">...</text>
<text>#0Talk-2nd time</text>
<text id="14000700">Ahh, there you are, Unkindled One.</text>
<text id="14000701">I am pleased to have a pupil as dedicated as you.</text>
<text id="14000702">...</text>
<text>#0Menu-Choose "Talk" 1st time before giving him a Pyromancy Tome</text>
<text id="14000900">To learn pyromancies, you must vow to become my pupil.</text>
<text id="14000901">I know, I know, but such is the way of the world.
Respect your elders, and so on.</text>
<text id="14000902">And pyromancy, of course, is no exception.</text>
<text id="14000903">...</text>
<text>#0Menu-Choose "Talk" 2nd time before giving him a Pyromancy Tome</text>
<text id="14001000">Oh, we'll need a pyromancy tome
to learn more advanced pyromancies.</text>
<text id="14001001">Though unorthodox,
that would be the most expedient way to make progress.</text>
<text id="14001002">If this were the Great Swamp, and you had the luxury of time,
we could have trained you the hard way.</text>
<text id="14001003">...</text>
<text>#0Menu-Choose "Give Pyromancy Tome" &amp; "Great Swamp Pyromancy Tome"</text>
<text id="14001400">Yes, here we are. It's been long indeed.</text>
<text id="14001401">With this, I can teach you more sophisticated pyromancies.</text>
<text id="14001402">Splendid. I can boast I am your tutor a little longer.</text>
<text id="14001403">...</text>
<text>#0Menu-Choose "Give Pyromancy Tome" &amp; "Carthus Pyromancy Tome"</text>
<text id="14001500">Well, well...I've never seen anything like this.</text>
<text id="14001501">This inscription...this tome is from the Catacombs.</text>
<text id="14001502">Fascinating. On this day, the teacher learns alongside the pupil.</text>
<text id="14001503">...</text>
<text>#0Menu-Choose "Give Pyromancy Tome" &amp; "Izalith Pyromancy Tome"</text>
<text id="14001600">Ah, what have we here! A pyromancy tome from Izalith!</text>
<text id="14001601">Then you've found the home of pyromancy.</text>
<text id="14001602">Brilliant. I will never curse being old and Undead again.</text>
<text id="14001603">Now, now, show it here, quickly. Let us channel them together.</text>
<text id="14001604">The primal pyromancies known only to old Master Salaman!</text>
<text>#0Menu-Choose "Give Pyromancy Tome" &amp; "Quelana Pyromancy Tome"</text>
<text id="14001700">Ahh, what have we here...</text>
<text id="14001701">By the gods. This inscription reads Quelana,
the ancient deity, one of the witches of Izalith...</text>
<text id="14001702">The last of them, who wandered the lands.
Then she must have returned to Izalith, after all.</text>
<text id="14001703">But I regret to say, I cannot accept this.</text>
<text id="14001704">Quelana's pyromancies are for witches,
and must be learned from a mistress.</text>
<text id="14001705">But thank you, for allowing me to peer upon such a thing.</text>
<text id="14001706">If only I were a woman.</text>
<text id="14001707">...</text>
<text>#0Menu-Choose "Give Pyromancy Tome" &amp; "Grave Warden Pyromancy Tome"</text>
<text id="14001800">I'm afraid I cannot accept this.</text>
<text id="14001801">This pyromancy tome is dark, and delves into the depths of men,
where an untouchable flame resides.</text>
<text id="14001802">I cannot comprehend this myself,
let alone teach it to you.</text>
<text id="14001803">It is a spell forbidden in the Great Swamp,
and nearly everywhere else, too.</text>
<text id="14001804">Only one terribly afflicted, or burdened by deep sorrow,
could begin to understand this.</text>
<text>#0Menu-Choose "Talk" after giving him the Great Swamp Pyromancy Tome</text>
<text id="14001100">If you seek pyromancy tomes, take this sage advice.</text>
<text id="14001101">The lands of the Lords converge upon Lothric.</text>
<text id="14001102">The home of pyromancies drifts comparatively close, as well.</text>
<text id="14001103">At least, that is what pyromancers of the Great Swamp believe.</text>
<text id="14001104">The place is called Izalith.
Oh, how I wish to behold a primal pyromancy.</text>
<text id="14001105">Well, these are old tales.
No one knows where the truth begins, or ends.</text>
<text id="14001106">...</text>
<text>#0Menu-Choose "Talk" after giving him the Carthus Pyromancy Tome</text>
<text id="14001200">Ahh, you found this tome in the Catacombs...</text>
<text id="14001201">This spell is akin to chaos.</text>
<text id="14001202">It may even serve as a link to Izalith, home of pyromancies...</text>
<text>#0Menu-Choose "Talk" after giving him the Izalith Pyromancy Tome</text>
<text id="14001300">Heed my words, Unkindled One.</text>
<text id="14001301">Fear the fire.</text>
<text id="14001302">The home of pyromancy, Izalith,
was scorched by the very fire it created.</text>
<text id="14001303">Undoubtedly, it was a flame of chaos, tangled by a witch's hand.</text>
<text id="14001304">But who's to say that this Bonfire's flame is any different?</text>
<text>#0Menu-Choose "Leave" or after leaving abruptly</text>
<text id="14000800">Do not be gone for long.</text>
<text id="14000801">What is a teacher without a pupil?</text>
<text id="14000802">...</text>
<text>#0Upon being attacked-1st time</text>
<text id="14001903">Why? What's the matter?</text>
<text>#0Upon being attacked-2nd time</text>
<text id="14001904">Stop this, stop this at once!</text>
<text>#0Upon being attacked &amp; made hostile</text>
<text id="14002000">Fine, fine, I see how it is.</text>
<text id="14002001">When a pupil strays from the path, the master must intrude.</text>
<text id="14002002">Prepare yourself, hatchling.</text>
<text id="14002003">Behold, the pyromancy of an old crow!</text>
<text>#0Upon killing the protagonist</text>
<text id="14002400">Spare the rod and spoil the child...</text>
<text>#0Upon dying</text>
<text id="14002102">I can't complain... This old reverie...had to end...</text>
<text id="14000404">##Cease this foolishness.</text>
<text id="14000500">##...</text>
<text id="14000502">##Hah hah hah hah!</text>
