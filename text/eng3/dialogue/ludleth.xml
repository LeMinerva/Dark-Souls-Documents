<text id="3000000">Oh, thou'rt unkindled, and a seeker of Lords.</text>
<text id="3000001">I am Ludleth of Courland.</text>
<text id="3000002">Look not in bewilderment as I say...
I linked the fire long ago, becoming a Lord of Cinder.</text>
<text id="3000003">If substantiation be thy want,
set thine eyes upon my charred corse.</text>
<text id="3000004">This sad cadav'r.
No need to be coy, have a closer look.</text>
<text id="3000005">(laugh)</text>
<text id="3000100">Fret not, fret not, my feet are here firmly planted.</text>
<text id="3000101">For I am a Lord, and this is my throne.</text>
<text id="3000102">(laugh)</text>
<text id="3000200">Ahh, beg pardon. I must have dozed a while.</text>
<text id="3000201">Fret not, fret not, my feet are here firmly planted.</text>
<text id="3000202">For I am a Lord, and this is my throne.</text>
<text id="3000203">(laugh)</text>
<text id="3000300">Ah-hah, thou'rt returned. And a fine day it is.</text>
<text id="3000301">So, happened upon any twisted souls?</text>
<text id="3000400">Ahh, beg pardon. I must have dozed a while.</text>
<text id="3000401">So, happened upon any twisted souls?</text>
<text id="3000500">Ahh, well met. All is as planned, is it not?</text>
<text id="3000501">Five lords for five thrones...</text>
<text id="3000502">Glory be, my Lord-slaying Champion. It is all thy doing.</text>
<text id="3000503">The stage is set for me to play my part as Lord, too.</text>
<text id="3000504">Go. Speak with the Fire Keeper.</text>
<text id="3000505">##She awaiteth thee.</text>
<text id="3000506">##...She hath waited a long time indeed...</text>
<text id="3000507">##(laugh)</text>
<text id="3000600">Now, now, do not be away overlong.</text>
<text id="3000601">(laugh)</text>
<text id="3000700">Knowest thou of our purpose?</text>
<text id="3000701">Five thrones will take five Lords,
as kindling for the linking of the fire.</text>
<text id="3000702">The fast-fading flame must be linked, to preserve this world.</text>
<text id="3000703">A re-enactment of the first linking of the fire.</text>
<text id="3000704">So it is I became a Lord of Cinder.</text>
<text id="3000705">I may be but small, but I will die a colossus.</text>
<text id="3000706">(laugh)</text>
<text id="3000800">Listen, this might pique thine interest.</text>
<text id="3000801">Before I was a Lord of Cinder, I was a student of transposition.</text>
<text id="3000802">The process of extracting, and coalescing, the essence of a soul.</text>
<text id="3000803">A forbidden art, that once left a foul stain upon Courland's honour.</text>
<text id="3000804">Tis an art that grants powers once thought unattainable.</text>
<text id="3000805">Most transposing kilns were lost with Courland,
but this place is a crossing for all manner of cursed objects.</text>
<text id="3000806">If thou happen'st 'pon a transposing kiln, bring it to me, quick.</text>
<text id="3000807">(laugh)</text>
<text id="3000900">Ahh, most illustrious Lordseeker.
Or should I say, Lord-slayer?</text>
<text id="3000901">Fine kindling for the thrones,
is it not, each soul truly worthy of Lordship.</text>
<text id="3000902">And all slain by thy hand.
To bind them to their thrones, even in death.</text>
<text id="3000903">Oh, I have no qualms.
For as we are to our thrones, thou art to thy duty.</text>
<text id="3000904">In fact, methinks thou'st helped
these poor Lords along their rightful path.</text>
<text id="3000905">...</text>
<text id="3000906">(laugh)</text>
<text id="3001000">Oh, belike it is...a transposing kiln in thy possession.</text>
<text id="3001001">Seen better days, but, methinks it shall suffice.</text>
<text id="3001002">Now, bring to me a twisted soul.</text>
<text id="3001003">Transposition is the art of extracting,
and coalescing, the essence of a soul.</text>
<text id="3001004">In transposing a twisted soul,
its true power transferreth to thee.</text>
<text id="3001005">Thy purpose is to seek Lords, and slay them.
What's to fear in a little transposition, now?</text>
<text id="3001006">(laugh)</text>
<text id="3001100">See ye not? I am a Lord...</text>
<text id="3001101">A wee flame, belike, but I shoulder the world...</text>
<text id="3001102">Forgive me. Oh, please...</text>
<text id="3001103">I am not to blame, I'm not...</text>
<text id="3001200">Ahh, it singeth, to the bone, it hurts...</text>
<text id="3001201">Please, help me. Be done with me...</text>
<text id="3001202">No, gods, no, I cannot bear it...</text>
<text id="3001203">It burns, burns, help me...</text>
<text id="3001300">...</text>
<text id="3001301">...</text>
<text id="3001400">...</text>
<text id="3001402">##Lord-slayer, do not fail us now...</text>
<text id="3001403">##Five Lords, for five thrones...</text>
<text id="3001500">Ahh, found her, did we?</text>
<text id="3001501">And the black eyes that shimmer within, I see?</text>
<text id="3001502">Tis as if it were but yesterday.</text>
<text id="3001503">We did all we could to spare her from them.</text>
<text id="3001504">Much has happened since.</text>
<text id="3001505">Mayhap I should apprise thee...</text>
<text id="3001506">Of what the thin light of these eyes might reveal,
to the eyeless Fire Keeper.</text>
<text id="3001507">Scenes of betrayal,
things never intended for her ken, visions of...</text>
<text id="3001508">...this age's end...</text>
<text id="3001509">(laugh)</text>
<text id="3001600">##Well well, what peculiar things thou keep'st on thy person...</text>
<text id="3001601">##Those I have seen before. Black eyes, if I am not mistaken?</text>
<text id="3001700">Ahh, well met. Thou'rt at last returned.</text>
<text id="3001701">Knowest thou the name, Anri of Astora?</text>
<text id="3001702">The brave girl left this, as thanks.</text>
<text id="3001703">The brave lad left this, as thanks.</text>
<text id="3001704">Though gave no elucidation...</text>
<text id="3001705">So. Happened upon any twisted souls?</text>
<text id="3001800">Ahh, well met. All is as planned, is it not?</text>
<text id="3001801">Five lords for five thrones...</text>
<text id="3001802">To think others might ne'er be raised...</text>
<text id="3001803">And I, of the Last Lords, a rather little lord,
most undeserving of the honour.</text>
<text id="3001805">Speak with the Fire Keeper.</text>
<text id="3001806">##She awaiteth thee.</text>
<text id="3001807">##...She hath waited a long time indeed...</text>
<text id="3001900">Treat the Fire Keeper not with discourtesy.</text>
<text id="3001901">She is much like thee. Prisoners, both, kept to link the fire.</text>
<text id="3001902">(laugh)</text>
<text id="3002000">I took the mantle of Lord of Cinder of mine own volition.
I speak these words with pride.</text>
<text id="3002001">Choose thy fate alone. Seize it with thine own hands.</text>
<text id="3002002">All the more, should thy fate entail such foul betrayal... </text>
<text id="3002003">(laugh)</text>
<text id="3002100">Now, heed this little warning, from this little lord.</text>
<text id="3002101">Seek not the girl.</text>
<text id="3002102">Seek not the boy.</text>
<text id="3002103">She knoweth her fate.
What will become of her upon her duty's end.</text>
<text id="3002104">She would not wish thee follow her.</text>
<text id="3002105">(laugh)</text>
<text id="3002153">He knoweth his fate.
What will become of him upon his duty's end.</text>
<text id="3002154">He would not wish thee follow him.</text>
<text id="3002200">The eyes shew a world destitute of fire,
a barren plane of endless darkness.</text>
<text id="3002201">A place born of betrayal.</text>
<text id="3002202">So I will'd myself Lord, to link the fire,
to paint a new vision.</text>
<text id="3002203">What is thine intent?</text>
<text id="3002204">(laugh)</text>
<text id="3002300">Ahh, thou'st two most peculiar swords discover'd.</text>
<text id="3002301">A curse once bound them together, such that they served as one.</text>
<text id="3002302">A transposing kiln should restore their rightful form.</text>
<text id="3002303">But before thou should'st act, think well upon the matter.</text>
<text id="3002304">As thou knowest, they are but newly rent apart.</text>
