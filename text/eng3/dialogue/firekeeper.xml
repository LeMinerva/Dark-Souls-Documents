manifestations of disparity, elucidated by fire...</text>
<text id="2000301">...burrow deep within me,
retreating to a darkness beyond the reach of flame.</text>

inhabiting ash, casting themselves upon new forms.</text>
<text id="2000303">An Unkindled slayer of lords; a Lord himself Unkindled.</text>

<text id="2000701">Has the little Lord Ludleth spoken to thee of any...curious matters?</text>
<text id="2000702">I sense that he possesseth some knowledge...</text>
<text id="2000703">Of a thing once most precious, or most terrible,

<text id="2000800">Ashen one, my thanks for the eyes thou'st given.</text>
<text id="2000801">But Fire Keepers are not meant to have eyes. It is forbidden.</text>
<text id="2000802">These will reveal, through a sliver of light,
frightful images of betrayal.</text>
<text id="2000803">A world without fire.</text>
<text id="2000804">Ashen one, is this truly thy wish?</text>
<text>#0Choose "Decline" to the query</text>

<text id="2001902">But 'tis different to what is seen when stripped of vision.</text>
<text id="2001903">In the far distance, I sense the presence of tiny flames.</text>
<text id="2001904">Like precious embers, left to us by past Lords, linkers of the fire.</text>
