<text>#0Talk-2nd time</text>
<text id="21000200">Hmm... Mmm...</text>
<text id="21000201">Oh!</text>
<text id="21000202">Pardon me. I was absorbed in thought.</text>
<text id="21000203">I am Siegward of Catarina.</text>
<text id="21000204">To be honest, I'm in a bit of a pickle.</text>
<text id="21000205">Have you ever walked near a white birch,
only to be struck by a great arrow?</text>
<text id="21000206">Well, if I'm not mistaken, they come from this tower.</text>
<text id="21000207">Whoever it is, I'm sure I can talk some sense into them.</text>
<text id="21000208">But I have to find a way up, and that's just the trouble.</text>
<text id="21000209">This lift only goes down, you see, and...</text>
<text id="21000210">Well, that doesn't get me anywhere... </text>
<text id="21000211">Hmm... Mmm...</text>
<text>#0Talk-3rd time</text>
<text id="21000300">This lift only goes down, but you know...</text>
<text id="21000301">With a little warming up, eventually... No, no...</text>
<text id="21000302">I've got to use my head. And think.</text>
<text id="21000303">Hmm... Mmm...</text>
<text>#0Talk-1st time after using elevator</text>
<text id="21000400">Hmm... Mmm...</text>
<text id="21000401">Ah, oh!</text>
<text id="21000402">Don't disappear like that. You had me downright worried.</text>
<text id="21000403">But thanks to you, an epiphany has struck me square in the head.</text>
<text id="21000404">I've unravelled the riddle of this inscrutable lift! </text>
<text id="21000405">...</text>
<text>#0Talk-2nd time after using elevator</text>
<text id="21000500">On some days, I begin to doubt myself.</text>
<text id="21000501">I went up the tower, so I thought, then somehow ended up here.</text>
<text id="21000502">I'm not exactly sure what happened.</text>
<text id="21000503">Anyhow, do you see that? That humungous beast.</text>
<text id="21000504">I'm no coward, and I've a steady hand,
but that thing makes my skin crawl.</text>
<text id="21000505">Now, now, think twice before you go down that road.</text>
<text>#0Talk-3rd time after using elevator</text>
<text id="21000600">I could try talking some sense into him...</text>
<text id="21000601">No, I think not. He's far too over-heated.</text>
<text id="21000602">I've got to use my head. And think.</text>
<text id="21000603">Hmm... Mmm...</text>
<text>#0After attacking the Demon</text>
<text id="21000700">No! You should have waited!</text>
<text id="21000701">Well, it's too late now.</text>
<text id="21000702">I, Siegward of the Knights of Catarina, fight by your side!</text>
<text id="21000703">...</text>
<text>#0Talk-1st time after defeating the Demon</text>
<text id="21000800">...</text>
<text id="21000801">That was quite the performance.</text>
<text id="21000802">But you mustn't get in over your head.</text>
<text id="21000803">We Unkindled must put our duties first.</text>
<text id="21000804">But for the moment, we've a toast to make.</text>
<text id="21000805">To your valour, my sword, and our victory together.</text>
<text id="21000806">Long may the sun shine!</text>
<text id="21000807">...</text>
<text>#0Talk-2nd time after defeating the Demon</text>
<text id="21000900">Well, I'm going to have myself a little nap.</text>

<text>#0Talk-1st time</text>
<text id="21001200">Oh!</text>
<text id="21001201">I know that voice. Just how long has it been!</text>
<text id="21001202">It's me, Siegward of Catarina.</text>
<text id="21001203">I'm loathe to admit it, but I've been had.</text>
<text id="21001204">Someone's swiped my armour.</text>
<text id="21001205">Did you happen to see it anywhere?</text>
<text>#0Choose "Haven't seen it" to the query</text>
<text id="21001500">Oh, yes, I see...</text>
<text id="21001501">Not to worry. Great planning begets great fortune.</text>
<text id="21001502">An old tenet of the Knights of Catarina.</text>
<text id="21001503">And I am a master planner, I do say!</text>

<text>#0Choose "Throw armor" to the query</text>
<text id="21001300">Ah, oh! My armour!</text>

<text id="21001302">With my trusty suit of armour, I'll be out of here in a jiffy.</text>

<text>#0Talk-3rd time</text>
<text id="21001900">I know. Won't you join me for dinner?</text>
<text id="21001901">I make a fine estus soup.
I've got some stewing right now.</text>
<text id="21001902">Even we Undead deserve a little normalcy, from time to time.</text>
<text id="21001903">And finally, upon this rendezvous, let us make a toast.</text>
<text id="21001904">To your valour, my sword, and our sworn duties!</text>

<text id="21002000">Have you heard?</text>
<text id="21002001">Somewhere, hidden right here in Irithyll, is a deep dungeon.</text>
<text id="21002002">And even below that, the Profaned Capital.</text>
<text id="21002003">Home of Yhorm, the reclusive giant lord.</text>
