<text id="20000000">Well, you look reasonably sane.</text>
<text id="20000001">I am a knight of Catarina.</text>
<text id="20000002">I've managed to track down this cathedral's store of treasure.</text>
<text id="20000003">It's right over there, across that narrow part.</text>
<text id="20000004">Treasure...hmm. Always so close, yet so far...</text>
<text id="20000005">I'm in quite a pickle, indeed...</text>
<text id="20000006">Hmm... Hmm...</text>
<text id="20000100">Just hold your horses a moment.</text>
<text id="20000101">I know, I know, treasure is so sorely tempting...</text>
<text id="20000102">Hmm... Hmm...</text>
<text id="20000200">Shame on you, you greedy guts. </text>
<text id="20000201">Shame on you, you insatiable wench.</text>
<text id="20000202">Shame on you, you rotten cleric.</text>
<text id="20000203">Shame on you, you rotten nun.</text>
<text id="20000204">Thought you could outwit an onion?</text>
<text id="20000205">Well, say hello to the nice giant! He adores visitors.</text>
<text id="20000206">...</text>
<text id="20000207">...</text>
<text id="20000300">Huh? Where's the old giant?</text>
<text id="20000301">What! Where's the bloody giant!</text>
<text id="20000302">Just what have you done?!</text>
<text id="20000303">How dare you! Have you no shame!</text>
<text id="20000304">Damn! Damn! Damn!</text>
<text id="20000400">Oh, yes, oh, hello, I don't believe we've met.</text>
<text id="20000401">I'm Patches. Unbreakable Patches.</text>
<text id="20000402">You seem to be Unkindled.</text>
<text id="20000403">Do you have business with me?</text>
<text id="20000500">Ah, oh, yes, of course...It's coming back to me, now.</text>
<text id="20000501">Oh, I am so sorry. That was my hand, as you know,
but the deed, well, that was the armour's doing.</text>
<text id="20000502">Regrettable, truly.
But behold, I'm stripped clean of that unruly attire.</text>
<text id="20000503">And look at you, not a scratch!</text>
<text id="20000504">All's well that ends well, right?</text>
<text id="20000505">Yes, we'll be fine, I can tell,
it's that rotten curse, it is, the untidy mess.</text>
<text id="20000506">...</text>
<text id="20000600">Oh, ahh, yes,
now, it wasn't me, but you still deserve an apology.</text>
<text id="20000601">Just a little trinket. Go ahead, it's yours now.</text>
<text id="20000602">...</text>
<text id="20000603">You should know, I'm a kind of traveling merchant.</text>
<text id="20000604">If you're as Unkindled as you look,
you'll find plenty of good stuff.</text>
<text id="20000700">Oh, yes, yes, what can I do?</text>
<text id="20000701">Can't resist it, can you? My sumptuous selection.</text>
<text id="20000800">Oh, hello again. Welcome to Patches' boutique of wonders.</text>
<text id="20000801">Can't resist it, can you? My sumptuous selection.</text>
<text id="20000900">Thanks, good compeer.</text>
<text id="20000901">Thanks, sweeting.</text>
<text id="20001000">Can't find anything you like?</text>
<text id="20001001">Well, you could try looking a little harder...</text>
<text id="20001100">Of course not, we have just met, after all.</text>
<text id="20001101">Sorry, I've been a bit on edge. Forget I even asked.</text>
<text id="20001102">...</text>
<text id="20001103">Ahh, but this is your lucky day.</text>
<text id="20001104">I happen to be a world-renowned travelling merchant.</text>
<text id="20001105">If you're as Unkindled as you look,
you'll find many a useful thing here.</text>
<text id="20001200">Sorry, friend.</text>
<text id="20001201">Be more careful! By the gods, curiosity is going to kill you kittens.</text>
<text id="20001202">Some places are better left alone, you know.</text>
<text id="20001203">Oh, sorry, am I a tad too late?</text>
<text id="20001204">...</text>
<text id="20001300">Have no fear, there's beauty in death.</text>
<text id="20001301">Besides, you're surrounded by ladies. Every man's dream, right?</text>
<text id="20001302">Besides, you're amongst your own. Plenty of company, right?</text>
<text id="20001303">Besides, you're surrounded by ladies.
Every rotten cleric's dream, right?</text>
<text id="20001304">...</text>
<text id="20001400">Oh, no matter, I'll look after things.</text>
<text id="20001401">By stripping every last trinket off your corpse.</text>
<text id="20001402">You're going to make some lucky customer very happy!</text>
<text id="20001403">...</text>
<text id="20001500">Ah, oh, you, you're alive...</text>
<text id="20001501">Now, hold your horses, let's have a nice talk about this.</text>
<text id="20001502">I'll come clean, I did you wrong.
I didn't mean it, though, not one bit.</text>
<text id="20001503">You get these...urges...running the business and all...
Oh, and I hate myself for it, I do.</text>
<text id="20001504">You know what I mean? Terrible, really.
But I can see you'll forgive me.</text>
<text id="20001505">You're alive, after all,
and that's what counts, right?</text>
<text id="20001600">Oh, fantastic! A wily second chance!</text>
<text id="20001601">I knew you'd understand, I just knew it.</text>
<text id="20001602">The heart of a lion.
A model for the rest of us. A true friend, forever.</text>
<text id="20001603">...</text>
<text id="20001700">Oh, for heaven's sake, no need to jest with a face like that.</text>
<text id="20001701">You're still alive, and I'm here grovelling in the dirt, so to speak.</text>
<text id="20001702">Oh, I know! Here, a token of my sincerity. Right and proper, eh?</text>
<text id="20001703">We're just a couple of outcasts, let's make the best of it!</text>
<text id="20001704">...</text>
<text id="20001800">Oh, yes yes, what can I do?</text>
<text id="20001801">Aren't you glad we made good of things?</text>
<text id="20001900">Oh, hello again. Welcome to Patches' boutique of wonders.</text>
<text id="20001901">Can't resist it, can you? My sumptuous selection.</text>
<text id="20002000">Thanks, good compeer.</text>
<text id="20002001">Thanks, sweeting.</text>
<text id="20002100">Can't find anything you like?</text>
<text id="20002101">Well, you could try looking a little harder...</text>
<text id="20002200">Well, look at you. The luckiest man in the world.</text>
<text id="20002201">Well, look at you. The luckiest lass in the world.</text>
<text id="20002202">I just got hold of some truly fine treasure.
And for you, I'll practically give it away.</text>
<text id="20002203">...</text>
<text id="20002300">What do you say? Brilliant stuff, eh?</text>
<text id="20002301">I won't ask for thanks, but I certainly deserve it.</text>
<text id="20002302">...</text>
<text id="20002400">Now, just wait, that's the best you can do? Bloody hell.</text>
<text id="20002401">Yeah, keep those purse strings nice and tight.
So tight they choke you.</text>
<text id="20002500">Ahh, I see you've met Greirat.</text>
<text id="20002501">The slinking rodent.
But he did me a good turn back in Lothric dungeon.</text>
<text id="20002502">Doubtless I should do something about that little debt,
or...maybe not.</text>
<text id="20002503">Well, I can hardly believe he's still standing.</text>
<text id="20002504">...</text>
<text id="20002600">Hey, what happened to Greirat, anyhow?</text>
<text id="20002601">I haven't seen him at all lately.</text>
<text id="20002602">If you know where he's scurried off to, be sure and tell me.</text>
<text id="20002603">I need to stock up, and if he's gone and croaked,
he'll have left a gold mine.</text>
<text id="20002604">...</text>
<text id="20002700">What? Gone all the way to Irithyll, has he?</text>
<text id="20002701">Well, there can't be much left of that frozen sprawl.</text>
<text id="20002702">The old rat, he's gone off the deep end this time...</text>
<text id="20002800">The old rat, he's gone off the deep end this time...</text>
<text id="20002900">Hmph. Off to Lothric, the castle of no return...</text>
<text id="20002901">That old thief's lost it if he thinks he has a chance in there.</text>
<text id="20002902">It's not like he's new to this game, what's gotten into him?</text>
<text id="20003000">That old thief, he's really lost it this time...</text>
<text id="20003100">Right, yes, I see how it is.</text>
<text id="20003101">Some things can't be divulged. Even between friends.</text>
<text id="20003102">It comes with the territory, I know.</text>
<text id="20003103">But if you happen to recall any details, do be a saint.</text>
<text id="20003104">Do it for old Patch's boutique of wonders, at least.</text>
<text id="20003105">...</text>
<text id="20003200">Well? Happen to recall anything important?</text>
<text id="20003201">About where that old rat scurried off to.</text>
<text id="20003202">...</text>
<text id="20003300">...</text>
<text id="20003301">...</text>
<text id="20003303">Oi, calm down, please!</text>
<text id="20003304">Forgive me! I'm on my hands and knees!</text>
<text id="20003305">All's well that ends well, right!</text>
<text id="20003306">Oh come on, you know it's true!</text>
<text id="20003400">Damn, you heartless, good-for-nothing oaf!</text>
<text id="20003401">Damn, you heartless little harlot! </text>
<text id="20003402">Well, now it's my turn.</text>
<text id="20003403">I'm Unbreakable Patches, nobody can crack me!</text>
<text id="20003404">Rot in hell!</text>
<text id="20003500">...</text>
<text id="20003502">Gods' piss, just my bloody luck...</text>
<text id="20003503">What did I ever do, anyway?</text>
<text id="20003600">Cough 'em up, every last one of 'em.</text>
<text id="20003601">Confess your sins.</text>
<text id="20003700">...</text>
<text id="20003701">...</text>
<text id="20003703">What's happened, friend?</text>
<text id="20003704">Stop this! Stop this at once!</text>
<text id="20003800">Gods' spit, I knew something was wrong!</text>
<text id="20003801">Well, now it's my turn.</text>
<text id="20003802">I'm Unbreakable Patches, nobody can crack me!</text>
<text id="20003803">Rot in hell!</text>
<text id="20003900">...</text>
<text id="20003902">Gods' spit and piss and blood...</text>
<text id="20003903">Why me? Why me?!</text>
<text id="20004000">Close call, blimey...</text>
<text id="73000000">Oh, look at you, you've got your head screwed on correct.</text>
<text id="73000001">Fantastic. To meet a kindred spirit, on this godsforsaken crag.</text>
<text id="73000002">Call me Lapp.
I can't remember my real name, so let's just go with that.</text>
<text id="73000003">I have a feeling we're going to make a fabulous team.
Oh, you'll see, you'll see!</text>
<text id="73000004">...</text>
<text id="73000100">Ohh, in all honesty there's something I should tell you...</text>
<text id="73000101">I'm...a Hollow.
Yes, I try to play it off, but I haven't a clue about my past.</text>
<text id="73000102">Who I was, or what I lived for.
Not even my own blessed name.</text>
<text id="73000103">That's why I've come here, searching.</text>
<text id="73000104">For the Purging Monument, said to be in the Ringed City,</text>
<text id="73000107">where the pygmies,
who found the Dark Soul at the dawn of fire, reside.</text>
<text id="73000105">All I can say is... Those little stones
aren't doing much to help me remember anymore...</text>
<text id="73000106">...</text>
<text id="73000200">Well, that's the long and short of it.</text>
<text id="73000201">So, if I completely forget who you are, don't be wrath with me.</text>
<text id="73000202">C'mon, what else can I say? I'm a bloody Hollow, for heaven's sake.</text>
<text id="73000203">...</text>
<text id="73000300">Oh, I know who you are.</text>
<text id="73000301">Great to see you still in once piece.</text>
<text id="73000303">Cor, I can see why they call this the dreg-heap at the world's end.</text>
<text id="73000304">...Mangled remnants from every age, and every land...</text>
<text id="73000305">It actually sort of lends credence to the old rumours.</text>
<text id="73000306">That the Ringed City rests below it all.</text>
<text id="73000400">Ah, don't mind me. You needn't worry yourself with this nonsense.</text>
<text id="73000401">I just wanted to tell someone, and I'm sick of old humpty.
I should stay quiet.</text>
<text id="73000402">Wait, I'll make it up to you, by letting you in on a secret of sorts.</text>
<text id="73000403">Past here, you'll find the remains of a giant earthen tower
half-submerged in a poisonous swamp.</text>
<text id="73000404">Not a very nice place to visit...
Only, there's precious treasure in the thick of the swamp.</text>
<text id="73000405">I didn't have any use for it, you see.
So sorry, I left the whole package behind.</text>
<text id="73000406">If I get the chance, I could go fetch it for you,
but if that's too long to wait, go nab it for yourself.</text>
<text id="73000407">...I know who you are.
A righteous warrior, yes? With a solemn duty, to boot. </text>
<text id="73000408">Well, grab that treasure, that's as good a duty as any.</text>
<text id="73000500">##Oh, wait, I forgot to give you a wee warning.</text>
<text id="73000501">##Watch out for the Dark Spirit lurking at the earthen tower.</text>
<text id="73000502">##I'm hollow, so it won't bother me,
but you're still human, I presume?</text>
<text id="73000503">##Hmm, must be nice. Really, must be nice!</text>
<text id="73000504">##...</text>
<text id="73000600">Ohh, look at you, you found the treasure.</text>
<text id="73000601">Dashing, just dashing. You'll make good use of it, I'm sure.</text>
<text id="73000602">Now, this is a little toast, from me to you.</text>
<text id="73000603">Not much to speak of, but bottoms up.
To the greatest warrior there is.</text>
<text id="73000604">...</text>
<text id="73000700">Oh, there you are, perfect timing.</text>
<text id="73000701">You remember that treasure, in the thick of the poison swamp?</text>
<text id="73000702">Well, I fetched it for you, as promised.</text>
<text id="73000703">Oh, it was only a hop and a skip.
I needed a rest from old nan over there.</text>
<text id="73000704">Here, go ahead, it's yours.
Maybe it'll help you with that solemn duty of yours.</text>
<text id="73000705">...</text>
<text id="73000800">This really is a dreg-heap at the world's end.</text>
<text id="73000801">...Mangled remnants from every age, and every land...</text>
<text id="73000802">It actually sort of lends credence to the old rumours.</text>
<text id="73000803">That the Ringed City rests below it all.</text>
<text id="73000900">Oh, well, fancy meeting you here.</text>
<text id="73000901">A true blessing, that we should seek the same place,
and find ourselves standing here, together.</text>
<text id="73000902">I've got the last of my brew. Let's have our own little toast with it.</text>
<text id="73000903">To my search, and to your duty. And to the joy that lies before us.</text>
<text id="73000904">All right, then. Bottoms up!</text>
<text id="73000905">...</text>
<text id="73001000">Now, I'm off in search of the Purging Monument.</text>
<text id="73001001">Once I find it, everything will come back to me.</text>
<text id="73001002">Who I was, what I lived for, what my name was.</text>
<text id="73001003">And... What terrible grudges I held.</text>
<text id="73001004">...I dunno, I just have this feeling.
That that's the kind of man I was.</text>
<text id="73001005">Oh, don't hold it against me, I only think I was!</text>
<text id="73001006">...</text>
<text id="73001100">Now, I'm off in search of the Purging Monument.</text>
<text id="73001101">Once I find it, everything will come back to me.</text>
<text id="73001200">Oh, and here we are again.</text>
<text id="73001201">How goes things? I'm rather running in circles, I'm afraid.</text>
<text id="73001202">I can't find the Purging Monument.
And I've searched high and low...</text>
<text id="73001203">What if it was never here in the first place?</text>
<text id="73001204">Ah, bloody hell, what do I know...</text>
<text id="73001300">Sorry, I know it doesn't concern you...</text>
<text id="73001301">Seeing you all good and well,
I...I just sort of spilled my guts to you.</text>
<text id="73001302">Just forget it all. Like a good Hollow would!</text>
<text id="73001303">...</text>
<text id="73001400">...What did I come here in search of?</text>
<text id="73001401">...Damn, stop it, I'm unbreakable, unbreakable...</text>
<text id="73001500">...Ahh, please, someone tell me...</text>
<text id="73001501">..Who am I? Why am I here?</text>
<text id="73001600">Are you certain of that?</text>
<text id="73001601">No, sorry, I know you'd never lie to me.</text>
<text id="73001602">Thank you, thank you kindly. I'll speed right on over.</text>
<text id="73001603">...It won't be long now, before I know everything.</text>
<text id="73001604">Who I was, what I lived for, and what my name was.</text>
<text id="73001605">And I'll have you to thank for it all.</text>
<text id="73001700">Ahh, thank you, most sincerely.</text>
<text id="73001701">I swear upon my birth name.</text>
<text id="73001702">That I am your friend.
No matter what might come out, no matter what I was.</text>
<text id="73001703">If you would do me the honour,
allow me to be a true friend, always.</text>
<text id="73001800">...It won't be long now, before I know everything.</text>
<text id="73001801">Who I was, what I lived for, and what my name was.</text>
<text id="73001802">And I'll have you to thank for it all.</text>
<text id="73001900">Oh, finally, you've come.</text>
<text id="73001901">Now I know exactly who I was.
And for that, I've a little thanks to be giving.</text>
<text id="73001902">Go this way, and peep past the broken staircase.
Some awfully fine treasure's just sitting there all alone.</text>
<text id="73001903">It'll change your life...</text>
<text id="73002000">I've much to thank you for, so I'll say it again and again.</text>
<text id="73002001">Go this way, and peep past the broken staircase.
Some awfully fine treasure's just sitting there all alone.</text>
<text id="73002002">What, don't you believe me?</text>
<text id="73002100">Every age, it seems, is tainted by the greed of men.</text>
<text id="73002101">Rubbish, to one such as I, devoid of all worldly wants!</text>
<text id="73002102">...</text>
<text id="73002103">Hmmm, I dunno, maybe it's just the way we are.</text>
<text id="73002104">I'll stick you in my prayers. A fine dark soul, to you.</text>
<text id="73002200">...</text>
<text id="73002201">What's wrong, friend?</text>
<text id="73002202">Stop it! Oh, please!</text>
<text id="73002203">...</text>
<text id="73002204">...</text>
<text id="73002300">Bloody hell! Lost your mind, have you?</text>
<text id="73002301">Then I have no choice! Forgive me!</text>
<text id="73002400">...</text>
<text id="73002401">Perhaps...I deserved this...</text>
<text id="73002500">Forgive me, friend.</text>
<text id="73002501">I cannot die just yet.</text>
<text id="73002600">...</text>
<text id="73002601">What in bloody hell?</text>
<text id="73002602">Stop that! Enough of that!</text>
<text id="73002603">...</text>
<text id="73002604">...</text>
<text id="73002700">Bloody hell, you've lost your head, have you?</text>
<text id="73002701">Then, let's have a go, shall we.</text>
<text id="73002702">I'm unbreakable! You can't crack me!</text>
<text id="73002703">I'll rot yer flesh!</text>
<text id="73002800">...</text>
<text id="73002801">Curses, of all the luck...</text>
<text id="73002802">Everything always goes to pot, doesn't it...</text>
