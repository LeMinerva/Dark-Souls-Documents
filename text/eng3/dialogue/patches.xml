Yes, I try to play it off, but I haven't a clue about my past.</text>
<text id="73000102">Who I was, or what I lived for.
Not even my own blessed name.</text>

<text id="73000400">Ah, don't mind me. You needn't worry yourself with this nonsense.</text>
<text id="73000401">I just wanted to tell someone, and I'm sick of old humpty.
I should stay quiet.</text>
<text id="73000402">Wait, I'll make it up to you, by letting you in on a secret of sorts.</text>
<text id="73000403">Past here, you'll find the remains of a giant earthen tower

Only, there's precious treasure in the thick of the swamp.</text>
<text id="73000405">I didn't have any use for it, you see.
So sorry, I left the whole package behind.</text>
<text id="73000406">If I get the chance, I could go fetch it for you,

<text id="73000703">Oh, it was only a hop and a skip.
I needed a rest from old nan over there.</text>
