<text id="5000001">Please, grant me death. Undo my shackles.</text>
<text id="5000002">...</text>
<text id="5000100">Ohh...</text>
<text id="5000101">Ohh, then it's true...</text>
<text id="5000102">A Champion of Ash, as I live and breathe.</text>
<text id="5000103">To be in your presence is a great honour.</text>
<text id="5000104">I am Yoel of Londor, a pilgrim, as you can see, only...</text>
<text id="5000105">Somehow, I've failed to die as was ordained.</text>
<text id="5000106">Well, perhaps my calling lies elsewhere.</text>
<text id="5000107">Say, Champion of Ash,
how does the idea of taking me into your service strike you?</text>
<text id="5000108">I was once a sorcerer. Surely I can be of use.</text>
<text id="5000200">Ohh, I am honoured, truly.</text>
<text id="5000201">I should be dead, yet you have granted me purpose anew.</text>
<text id="5000202">I, Yoel of Londor, do solemnly swear myself to you.</text>
<text id="5000300">Ahh, mm, yes, of course.</text>
<text id="5000301">An accursed pilgrim has no place in your honourable service.</text>
<text id="5000302">But if a lost soul should encounter a legend such as you,</text>
<text id="5000303">could that be anything but a movement of fate?</text>
<text id="5000304">I will remain in this spot.</text>
<text id="5000305">Praying solemnly that you might have a change of heart.</text>
<text id="5000400">Ahh, Champion of Ash. Have you had a change of heart?</text>
<text id="5000401">I beg of you, take me into your service.</text>
<text id="5000500">...</text>
<text id="5000501">...</text>
<text id="5000503">What's come over you!</text>
<text id="5000600">...</text>
<text id="5000602">Killing Undead for sport, accursed champion?</text>
<text id="5000603">And a fool's sport it is...</text>
<text id="5000700">Oh, our Champion of Ash, welcome home.</text>
<text id="5000701">This pilgrim, with a debt in death,
hardly deserves to behold this divine flame.</text>
<text id="5000702">And I never would have, had you not taken me into your service.</text>
<text id="5000703">I thank you dearly for this... And assure you of my leal service.</text>
<text id="5000800">Oh, our Champion of Ash. Welcome back.</text>
<text id="5000801">By all means, tell me what you desire.</text>
<text id="5000900">Oh, our Champion of Ash. Welcome back.</text>
<text id="5000901">I would do anything for my master, just say the word.</text>
<text id="5001000">Be safe, Champion of Ash.</text>
<text id="5001100">Be safe, our Lord...</text>
<text id="5001200">As I have said, I was once a sorcerer.</text>
<text id="5001201">Alas, the magic of Londor is a far cry
from the wonders of Vinheim.</text>
<text id="5001202">But I can teach you what I know.</text>
<text id="5001203">Perhaps more importantly...</text>
<text id="5001204">I believe that I can help tease out your true strength.</text>
<text id="5001205">We pilgrims of Londor are keenly aware.</text>
<text id="5001206">That those branded by the Darksign
possess something quite special...</text>
<text id="5001300">Then, shall we begin?</text>
<text id="5001301">Bearer of the Darksign, let your true strength shine...</text>
<text id="5001400">Ahh, you have attained ample strength.</text>
<text id="5001401">All will soon be clear, my good Lord...</text>
<text id="5001500">...</text>
<text id="5001501">...</text>
<text id="5001503">What do you intend?</text>
<text id="5001600">...</text>
<text id="5001602">Champion of ash, what have you done?</text>
<text id="5001603">Lady Yuria...</text>
<text id="5001700">Ahh, I thank you kindly...</text>
<text id="5001701">Our kindest Lord...</text>
