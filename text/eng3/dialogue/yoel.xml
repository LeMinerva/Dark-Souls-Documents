<text id="5000103">To be in your presence is a great honour.</text>
<text id="5000104">I am Yoel of Londor, a pilgrim, as you can see, only...</text>
<text id="5000105">Somehow, I've failed to die as was ordained.</text>
<text id="5000106">Well, perhaps my calling lies elsewhere.</text>
<text id="5000107">Say, Champion of Ash,
how does the idea of taking me into your service strike you?</text>
<text id="5000108">I was once a sorcerer. Surely I can be of use.</text>
<text>#0Choose "Decline" to either the 1st or 2nd query</text>
<text id="5000300">Ahh, mm, yes, of course.</text>
<text id="5000301">An accursed pilgrim has no place in your honourable service.</text>
<text id="5000302">But if a lost soul should encounter a legend such as you,</text>
<text id="5000303">could that be anything but a movement of fate?</text>
<text id="5000304">I will remain in this spot.</text>
<text id="5000305">Praying solemnly that you might have a change of heart.</text>
<text>#0After choosing "Decline" to either the 1st or 2nd query</text>
<text id="5000400">Ahh, Champion of Ash. Have you had a change of heart?</text>
<text id="5000401">I beg of you, take me into your service.</text>
<text>#0Choose "Accept his service" to either the 1st or 2nd query</text>
<text id="5000200">Ohh, I am honoured, truly.</text>
<text id="5000201">I should be dead, yet you have granted me purpose anew.</text>

<text>#0Talk-1st time</text>
<text id="5000700">Oh, our Champion of Ash, welcome home.</text>
<text id="5000701">This pilgrim, with a debt in death,
hardly deserves to behold this divine flame.</text>
<text id="5000702">And I never would have, had you not taken me into your service.</text>
<text id="5000703">I thank you dearly for this... And assure you of my leal service.</text>

<text id="5001202">But I can teach you what I know.</text>
<text id="5001203">Perhaps more importantly...</text>
<text id="5001204">I believe that I can help tease out your true strength.</text>
<text id="5001205">We pilgrims of Londor are keenly aware.</text>
<text id="5001206">That those branded by the Darksign
possess something quite special...</text>
