<text id="55000000">Welcome. To the painted world of Ariandel.</text>
<text id="55000001">I am Friede.
I have long stood beside our blessed Father,
and the rest of the Forlorn.</text>
<text id="55000002">But Forlorn thou seemeth not.</text>
<text id="55000003">Ashen One,
I know not the missteps which led thee to this Painted World.</text>
<text id="55000004">But thy duty is all, and thy duty lieth elsewhere.</text>
<text id="55000005">Return from whence thou cam'st.</text>

to be sure, but perhaps it was meant to be.</text>
<text id="55000102">Let this be a remembrance of this cold world,
a thing to help thee bear thy duty.</text>
<text id="55000103">Now, return from whence thou cam'st.</text>
<text id="55000104">Thou'st a place in that world, and that alone is cause to rejoice.</text>
