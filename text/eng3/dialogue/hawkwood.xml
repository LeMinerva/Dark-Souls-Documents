<text id="7000000">Ahhh, another one, roused from the sleep of death?</text>
<text id="7000001">Well, you're not alone. We Unkindled are worthless.
Can't even die right.</text>
<text id="7000002">Gives me conniptions.</text>
<text id="7000003">And they'd have us seek the Lords of Cinder,
and return them to their moulding thrones.</text>
<text id="7000004">But we're talking true legends with the mettle to link the fire.
We're not fit to lick their boots.</text>
<text id="7000005">Don't you think?</text>
<text id="7000006">...</text>
<text>#0Talk-2nd time</text>
<text id="7000100">What a sick joke.</text>
<text id="7000101">Asking us to seek the Lords of Cinder,
and return them to their moulding thrones.</text>
<text id="7000102">We're talking true legends, those who would link the fire.
We're not fit to lick their boots.</text>

<text>#0Talk-1st time after raising the Small Lothric Banner</text>
<text id="7000200">Oooh, yet to give in, eh?</text>
<text id="7000201">Good. The Fire Keeper must be twitching with delight.</text>
<text id="7000202">But what do you really know about these Lords of Cinder,
these supposed legends?</text>
<text id="7000203">Let's take Aldrich, for one.</text>
<text id="7000204">A right and proper cleric,
only, he developed a habit of devouring men.</text>
<text id="7000205">He ate so many that he bloated like a drowned pig,
then softened into sludge,
so they stuck him in the Cathedral of the Deep.</text>
<text id="7000206">And they made him a Lord of Cinder.
Not for virtue, but for might.</text>
<text id="7000207">Such is a lord, I suppose.
But here I ask. Do we have a sodding chance?</text>
<text id="7000208">...</text>
<text>#0Talk-2nd time after raising the Small Lothric Banner</text>
<text id="7000300">At the foot of Lothric Castle,
an old path still runs below the tower in the Undead Settlement.</text>
<text id="7000301">It was used to transport sacrifices to the Cathedral of the Deep.
You should see where it leads.</text>
<text id="7000302">...If you've the stones for it.</text>
<text id="7000303">...</text>
<text>#0Talk-1st time after defeating the Curse-rotted Greatwood or Crystal Sage</text>
<text id="7000400">You haven't given up yet?
 Then you're a brasher lad than I thought.</text>
<text id="7000401">You haven't given up yet?
 Then you're a brasher lass than I thought.</text>
<text id="7000402">You can make better use of this.</text>
<text id="7000403">A medallion to gain entry to the keep
of the Undead Legion of Farron,
Lords of Cinder in their own right.</text>
<text id="7000404">I don't need it. Not now I've flown the coop.</text>
<text id="7000405">...</text>
<text>#0Talk-2nd time after defeating the Curse-rotted Greatwood or Crystal Sage</text>
<text id="7000500">The Undead Legion of Farron is a caravan of Undead.</text>
<text id="7000501">Sworn by wolf's blood to contain the Abyss,
the Legion will bury a kingdom at the first sign of exposure.</text>
<text id="7000502">Joyous bunch, really.</text>
<text id="7000503">Gaining admission to the Legion is a matter of some ceremony.</text>
<text id="7000504">Inside their keep, snuffing out the flames of
three altars opens the door to the wolf blood.</text>
<text id="7000506">Even accursed Undead want to believe they're special, it seems.</text>
<text id="7000507">I pity the sorry souls.</text>
<text id="7000508">...</text>

<text id="7000701">So that's how they're delivered to their thrones...</text>
<text id="7000702">...</text>
<text id="7000703">I pity the sorry souls. Is that really lordship's last reward?</text>

<text id="7000900">The poor, wretched souls...</text>
<text id="7000901">Be they lord or legend, the curse shows no mercy.</text>
<text id="7000902">What a sham.</text>
